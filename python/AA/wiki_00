Anarchism

Anarchism is a </entity/>political-philosophy political-philosophy that advocates </entity/>stateless-society </mention/>stateless-societies often defined as </entity/>self-governance </mention/>self-governed voluntary institutions, but that several authors have defined as more specific institutions based on non-</entity/>Hierarchy </mention/>hierarchical </entity/>Free-association-(communism-and-anarchism) </mention/>free-associations. Anarchism holds the </entity/>state-(polity) </mention/>state to be undesirable, unnecessary, or harmful. While anti-statism is central, anarchism entails opposing </entity/>authority authority or </entity/>hierarchical-organisation hierarchical-organisation in the conduct of human relations, including, but not limited to, the state system.
As a subtle and anti-dogmatic philosophy, anarchism draws on many currents of thought and strategy. Anarchism does not offer a fixed body of doctrine from a single particular world view, instead fluxing and flowing as a philosophy. There are many types and traditions of anarchism, not all of which are mutually exclusive. </entity/>Anarchist-schools-of-thought Anarchist-schools-of-thought can differ fundamentally, supporting anything from extreme </entity/>individualism individualism to complete collectivism. Strains of anarchism have often been divided into the categories of </entity/>social-anarchism </mention/>social and </entity/>individualist-anarchism individualist-anarchism or similar dual classifications. Anarchism is usually considered a radical left-wing ideology, and much of </entity/>anarchist-economics anarchist-economics and </entity/>anarchist-law </mention/>anarchist-legal-philosophy reflect </entity/>Libertarian-socialism </mention/>anti-authoritarian-interpretations of </entity/>anarcho-communism </mention/>communism, </entity/>collectivist-anarchism </mention/>collectivism, </entity/>anarcho-syndicalism </mention/>syndicalism, </entity/>Mutualism-(economic-theory) </mention/>mutualism, or </entity/>participatory-economics participatory-economics.
The central tendency of anarchism as a social movement has been represented by </entity/>Anarchist-communism </mention/>anarcho-communism and </entity/>anarcho-syndicalism anarcho-syndicalism, with </entity/>individualist-anarchism individualist-anarchism being primarily a literary phenomenon. Many anarchists oppose all forms of aggression, supporting </entity/>self-defense self-defense or </entity/>non-violence non-violence (</entity/>anarcho-pacifism anarcho-pacifism), while others have supported revolution and </entity/>propaganda-of-the-deed propaganda-of-the-deed as means to achieve anarchist ends.
Notably, anarchist revolutions occurred in Spain (</entity/>Spanish-Revolution Spanish-Revolution) and Ukraine (</entity/>Free-Territory Free-Territory), began a process of transforming society, and were heavily tied to the concepts of socialism, communism and the working class. Both were stopped by force.
Etymology and terminology.
The term "</entity/>wikt:anarchism </mention/>anarchism" is a compound word composed from the word "</entity/>anarchy anarchy" and the suffix "</entity/>-ism -ism", themselves derived respectively from the Greek , i.e. "anarchy" (from , "anarchos", meaning "one without rulers"; from the </entity/>privative privative prefix </entity/>privative-alpha </mention/>ἀν- ("an-", i.e. "without") and , "archos", i.e. "leader", "ruler"; (cf. "</entity/>archon archon" or , "arkhē", i.e. "authority", "sovereignty", "realm", "magistracy")) and the suffix or ("-ismos", "-isma", from the verbal </entity/>infinitive infinitive suffix -ίζειν, "-izein"). The first known use of this word was in 1539."Anarchist" was the term adopted by </entity/>Maximilien-de-Robespierre Maximilien-de-Robespierre to attack those on the left whom he had used for his own ends during the French Revolution but was determined to get rid of, though among these "anarchists" there were few who exhibited the social revolt characteristics of later anarchists. There would be many revolutionaries of the early nineteenth century who contributed to the anarchist doctrines of the next generation, such as </entity/>William-Godwin William-Godwin and </entity/>Wilhelm-Weitling Wilhelm-Weitling, but they did not use the word "anarchist" or "anarchism" in describing themselves or their beliefs. </entity/>Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon was the first political philosopher to call himself an anarchist, marking the formal birth of anarchism in the mid-nineteenth century. Since the 1890s from France, the term "libertarianism" has often been used as a synonym for anarchism and was used almost exclusively in this sense until the 1950s in the United States; its use as a synonym is still common outside the United States. On the other hand, some use "</entity/>libertarianism libertarianism" to refer to individualistic free-market philosophy only, referring to free-market anarchism as "</entity/>libertarian-anarchism libertarian-anarchism".
History.
Origins.
</entity/>
The earliest anarchist themes can be found in the 6th century BC, among the works of </entity/>Taoism </mention/>Taoist philosopher </entity/>Laozi Laozi, and in later centuries by </entity/>Zhuang-Zhou </mention/>Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan. Zhuangzi's philosophy has been described by various sources as anarchist. Zhuangzi wrote, "A petty thief is put in jail. A great </entity/>wikt:brigand </mention/>brigand becomes a ruler of a Nation." </entity/>Diogenes-of-Sinope Diogenes-of-Sinope and the </entity/>Cynicism-(philosophy) </mention/>Cynics, their contemporary </entity/>Zeno-of-Citium Zeno-of-Citium, the founder of </entity/>Stoicism Stoicism, also introduced similar topics. Jesus is sometimes considered the first anarchist in the </entity/>Christian-anarchism </mention/>Christian-anarchist tradition. Georges Lechartier wrote that "The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and ... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles." In early Islamic history, some manifestations of anarchic thought are found during the </entity/>Second-Fitna </mention/>Islamic-civil-war over the </entity/>Caliphate Caliphate, where the </entity/>Kharijites Kharijites insisted that the </entity/>imamate imamate is a right for each individual within the Islamic society. Later, some </entity/>Muslim Muslim scholars, such as Amer al-Basri and </entity/>Abu-Hanifa Abu-Hanifa, led movements of boycotting the rulers, paving the way to the </entity/>waqf waqf (endowments) tradition, which served as an alternative to and asylum from the centralized authorities of the emirs. But such interpretations reverberates subversive religious conceptions like the aforementioned seemingly anarchistic Taoist teachings and that of other anti-authoritarian religious traditions creating a complex relationship regarding the question as to whether or not </entity/>Anarchism-and-religion </mention/>anarchism-and-religion-are-compatible. This is exemplified when the glorification of the state is viewed as a form of sinful </entity/>idolatry idolatry.
The French </entity/>Renaissance-humanism </mention/>renaissance political philosopher </entity/>Étienne-de-La-Boétie Étienne-de-La-Boétie wrote in his most famous work the "Discourse on Voluntary Servitude" what some historians consider an important anarchist precedent.
The radical </entity/>Protestant-Christianity </mention/>Protestant-Christian </entity/>Gerrard-Winstanley Gerrard-Winstanley and his group the </entity/>Diggers Diggers are cited by various authors as proposing anarchist social measures in the 17th century in England. The term "anarchist" first entered the English language in 1642, during the </entity/>English-Civil-War English-Civil-War, as a </entity/>Pejorative </mention/>term-of-abuse, used by </entity/>Cavalier </mention/>Royalists against their </entity/>Roundhead Roundhead opponents. By the time of the </entity/>French-Revolution French-Revolution some, such as the "</entity/>Enragés Enragés", began to use the term positively, in opposition to </entity/>Jacobin-(politics) </mention/>Jacobin centralisation of power, seeing "revolutionary government" as </entity/>oxymoron oxymoronic. By the turn of the 19th century, the English word "anarchism" had lost its initial negative connotation.
Modern anarchism sprang from the secular or religious thought of the </entity/>Age-of-Enlightenment </mention/>Enlightenment, particularly </entity/>Jean-Jacques-Rousseau Jean-Jacques-Rousseau's arguments for the moral centrality of freedom.
As part of the political turmoil of the 1790s in the wake of the </entity/>French-Revolution French-Revolution, </entity/>William-Godwin William-Godwin developed the first expression of </entity/>anarchist-schools-of-thought </mention/>modern-anarchist-thought. Godwin was, according to </entity/>Peter-Kropotkin Peter-Kropotkin, "the first to formulate the political and economical conceptions of anarchism, even though he did not give that name to the ideas developed in his work", while Godwin attached his anarchist ideas to an early </entity/>Edmund-Burke Edmund-Burke.
</entity/>
Godwin is generally regarded as the founder of the school of thought known as 'philosophical anarchism'. He argued in "</entity/>Political-Justice Political-Justice" (1793) that government has an inherently malevolent influence on society, and that it perpetuates dependency and ignorance. He thought that the spread of the use of reason to the masses would eventually cause government to wither away as an unnecessary force. Although he did not accord the state with moral legitimacy, he was against the use of revolutionary tactics for removing the government from power. Rather, he advocated for its replacement through a process of peaceful evolution.
His aversion to the imposition of a rules-based society led him to denounce, as a manifestation of the people’s ‘mental enslavement’, the foundations of </entity/>law law, </entity/>property-rights property-rights and even the institution of </entity/>marriage marriage. He considered the basic foundations of society as constraining the natural development of individuals to use their powers of reasoning to arrive at a mutually beneficial method of social organisation. In each case, government and its institutions are shown to constrain the development of our capacity to live wholly in accordance with the full and free exercise of private judgment.
The French </entity/>Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon is regarded as the first "self-proclaimed" anarchist, a label he adopted in his groundbreaking work, "</entity/>What-is-Property? What-is-Property?," published in 1840. It is for this reason that some claim Proudhon as the founder of modern anarchist theory. He developed the theory of </entity/>spontaneous-order spontaneous-order in society, where organisation emerges without a central coordinator imposing its own idea of order against the wills of individuals acting in their own interests; his famous quote on the matter is, "Liberty is the mother, not the daughter, of order." In "What is Property?" Proudhon answers with the famous accusation "</entity/>Property-is-theft Property-is-theft." In this work, he opposed the institution of decreed "property" ("propriété"), where owners have complete rights to "use and abuse" their property as they wish. He contrasted this with what he called "possession," or limited ownership of resources and goods only while in more or less continuous use. Later, however, Proudhon added that "Property is Liberty," and argued that it was a bulwark against state power. His opposition to the state, organised religion, and certain capitalist practices inspired subsequent anarchists, and made him one of the leading social thinkers of his time.
The anarcho-communist </entity/>Joseph-Déjacque Joseph-Déjacque was the first person to describe himself as "</entity/>libertarian-socialism </mention/>libertarian". Unlike </entity/>Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon, he argued that, "it is not the product of his or her labour that the worker has a right to, but to the satisfaction of his or her needs, whatever may be their nature." In 1844 in Germany the post-hegelian philosopher </entity/>Max-Stirner Max-Stirner published the book, "</entity/>The-Ego-and-Its-Own The-Ego-and-Its-Own," which would later be considered an influential early text of </entity/>individualist-anarchism individualist-anarchism. French anarchists active in the </entity/>1848-Revolution 1848-Revolution included </entity/>Anselme-Bellegarrigue Anselme-Bellegarrigue, Ernest Coeurderoy, </entity/>Joseph-Déjacque Joseph-Déjacque and </entity/>Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon.
First International and the Paris Commune.
</entity/>
In Europe, harsh reaction followed the </entity/>revolutions-of-1848 revolutions-of-1848, during which ten countries had experienced brief or long-term social upheaval as groups carried out nationalist uprisings. After most of these attempts at systematic change ended in failure, conservative elements took advantage of the divided groups of socialists, anarchists, liberals, and nationalists, to prevent further revolt. In Spain Ramón de la Sagra established the anarchist journal "El Porvenir" in La Coruña in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon´s ideas. The </entity/>Catalan-people </mention/>Catalan politician </entity/>Francesc-Pi-i-Margall Francesc-Pi-i-Margall became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish and later briefly became president of Spain in 1873 while being the leader of the Democratic Republican Federal Party. According to </entity/>George-Woodcock George-Woodcock "These translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's." According to the "</entity/>Encyclopedia-Britannica Encyclopedia-Britannica" "During the Spanish revolution of 1873, Pi y Margall </entity/>Cantonal-Revolution </mention/>attempted-to-establish-a-decentralized,-or-“cantonalist,”-political-system on Proudhonian lines."
In 1864 the </entity/>International-Workingmen's-Association International-Workingmen's-Association (sometimes called the "First International") united diverse revolutionary currents including French followers of </entity/>Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon </mention/>Proudhon, </entity/>Blanquism </mention/>Blanquists, </entity/>Philadelphes Philadelphes, English trade unionists, socialists and </entity/>social-democrats social-democrats. Due to its links to active workers' movements, the International became a significant organisation. </entity/>Karl-Marx Karl-Marx became a leading figure in the International and a member of its General Council. Proudhon's followers, the </entity/>Mutualism-(economic-theory) </mention/>mutualists, opposed Marx's </entity/>state-socialism state-socialism, advocating political </entity/>abstentionism abstentionism and small property holdings.
In 1868, following their unsuccessful participation in the </entity/>League-of-Peace-and-Freedom League-of-Peace-and-Freedom (LPF), Russian revolutionary </entity/>Mikhail-Bakunin Mikhail-Bakunin and his </entity/>collectivist-anarchism </mention/>collectivist-anarchist associates joined the First International (which had decided not to get involved with the LPF). They allied themselves with the </entity/>federalist federalist socialist sections of the International, who advocated the revolutionary overthrow of the state and the collectivization of property.
At first, the collectivists worked with the Marxists to push the First International in a more revolutionary socialist direction. Subsequently, the International became polarised into two camps, with Marx and Bakunin as their respective figureheads. Bakunin characterised Marx's ideas as </entity/>centralism </mention/>centralist and predicted that, if a Marxist party came to power, its leaders would simply take the place of the </entity/>ruling-class ruling-class they had fought against.
Anarchist historian </entity/>George-Woodcock George-Woodcock reports that "The annual Congress of the International had not taken place in 1870 owing to the outbreak of the Paris Commune, and in 1871 the General Council called only a special conference in London. One delegate was able to attend from Spain and none from Italy, while a technical excuse – that they had split away from the Fédération Romande – was used to avoid inviting Bakunin's Swiss supporters. Thus only a tiny minority of anarchists was present, and the General Council's resolutions passed almost unanimously. Most of them were clearly directed against Bakunin and his followers." In 1872, the conflict climaxed with a final split between the two groups at the </entity/>Hague-Congress-(1872) </mention/>Hague-Congress, where Bakunin and </entity/>James-Guillaume James-Guillaume were expelled from the International and its headquarters were transferred to New York. In response, the federalist sections formed their own International at the </entity/>Anarchist-St.-Imier-International </mention/>St.-Imier-Congress, adopting a revolutionary anarchist program.
The </entity/>Paris-Commune Paris-Commune was a government that briefly ruled Paris from 18 March (more formally, from 28 March) to 28 May 1871. The Commune was the result of an uprising in Paris after France was defeated in the Franco-Prussian War. Anarchists participated actively in the establishment of the Paris Commune. They included George Woodcock states:
Organised labour.
The anti-authoritarian sections of the First International were the precursors of the anarcho-syndicalists, seeking to "replace the privilege and authority of the State" with the "free and spontaneous organisation of labour." In 1886, the </entity/>Federation-of-Organized-Trades-and-Labor-Unions Federation-of-Organized-Trades-and-Labor-Unions (FOTLU) of the United States and Canada unanimously set 1 May 1886, as the date by which the </entity/>Eight-hour-day </mention/>eight-hour-work-day would become standard.
</entity/>
In response, unions across the United States prepared a </entity/>general-strike general-strike in support of the event. On 3 May, in Chicago, a fight broke out when </entity/>strikebreaker strikebreakers attempted to cross the picket line, and two workers died when police opened fire upon the crowd. The next day, 4 May, anarchists staged a rally at Chicago's Haymarket Square. A bomb was thrown by an unknown party near the conclusion of the rally, killing an officer. In the ensuing panic, police opened fire on the crowd and each other. Seven police officers and at least four workers were killed. Eight anarchists directly and indirectly related to the organisers of the rally were arrested and charged with the murder of the deceased officer. The men became international political celebrities among the labour movement. Four of the men were executed and a fifth committed suicide prior to his own execution. The incident became known as the </entity/>Haymarket-affair Haymarket-affair, and was a setback for the labour movement and the struggle for the eight-hour day. In 1890 a second attempt, this time international in scope, to organise for the eight-hour day was made. The event also had the secondary purpose of memorializing workers killed as a result of the Haymarket affair. Although it had initially been conceived as a once-off event, by the following year the celebration of </entity/>International-Workers'-Day International-Workers'-Day on May Day had become firmly established as an international worker's holiday.
In 1907, the </entity/>International-Anarchist-Congress-of-Amsterdam International-Anarchist-Congress-of-Amsterdam gathered delegates from 14 different countries, among which important figures of the anarchist movement, including </entity/>Errico-Malatesta Errico-Malatesta, </entity/>Pierre-Monatte Pierre-Monatte, </entity/>Luigi-Fabbri Luigi-Fabbri, </entity/>Benoît-Broutchoux Benoît-Broutchoux, </entity/>Emma-Goldman Emma-Goldman, </entity/>Rudolf-Rocker Rudolf-Rocker, and </entity/>Christiaan-Cornelissen Christiaan-Cornelissen. Various themes were treated during the Congress, in particular concerning the organisation of the anarchist movement, </entity/>popular-education popular-education issues, the </entity/>general-strike general-strike or </entity/>antimilitarism antimilitarism. A central debate concerned the relation between anarchism and </entity/>syndicalism syndicalism (or </entity/>trade-union trade-unionism). Malatesta and Monatte were in particular disagreement themselves on this issue, as the latter thought that syndicalism was revolutionary and would create the conditions of a </entity/>social-revolution social-revolution, while Malatesta did not consider syndicalism by itself sufficient. He thought that the trade-union movement was </entity/>reformism </mention/>reformist and even </entity/>Conservatism </mention/>conservative, citing as essentially bourgeois and anti-worker the phenomenon of professional union officials. Malatesta warned that the syndicalists aims were in perpetuating syndicalism itself, whereas anarchists must always have anarchy as their end and consequently refrain from committing to any particular method of achieving it.
The </entity/>Federación-Anarquista-Ibérica </mention/>Spanish-Workers-Federation in 1881 was the first major anarcho-syndicalist movement; anarchist trade union federations were of special importance in Spain. The most successful was the </entity/>Confederación-Nacional-del-Trabajo Confederación-Nacional-del-Trabajo (National Confederation of Labour: CNT), founded in 1910. Before the 1940s, the CNT was the major force in Spanish working class politics, attracting 1.58 million members at one point and playing a major role in the </entity/>Spanish-Civil-War Spanish-Civil-War. The CNT was affiliated with the </entity/>International-Workers-Association International-Workers-Association, a federation of anarcho-syndicalist trade unions founded in 1922, with delegates representing two million workers from 15 countries in Europe and Latin America. In Latin America in particular "The anarchists quickly became active in organizing craft and industrial workers throughout South and Central America, and until the early 1920s most of the trade unions in </entity/>Anarchism-in-Mexico </mention/>Mexico, </entity/>Anarchism-in-Brazil </mention/>Brazil, Peru, Chile, and Argentina were anarcho-syndicalist in general outlook; the prestige of the Spanish C.N.T. as a revolutionary organization was
undoubtedly to a great extent responsible for this situation. The largest and most militant of these organizations was the </entity/>Federación-Obrera-Regional-Argentina Federación-Obrera-Regional-Argentina ... it grew quickly to a membership of nearly a quarter of a million, which dwarfed the rival socialdemocratic unions."
Propaganda of the deed and illegalism.
</entity/>
Some anarchists, such as </entity/>Johann-Most Johann-Most, advocated publicizing violent acts of retaliation against counter-revolutionaries because "we preach not only action in and for itself, but also action as propaganda." By the 1880s, people inside and outside the anarchist movement began to use the slogan, "propaganda of the deed" to refer to individual bombings, </entity/>regicide regicides, and </entity/>tyrannicide tyrannicides. From 1905 onwards, the Russian counterparts of these anti-syndicalist anarchist-communists become partisans of economic terrorism and illegal '</entity/>Confiscation </mention/>expropriations'." </entity/>Illegalism Illegalism as a practice emerged and within it "The acts of the anarchist bombers and assassins ("</entity/>propaganda-by-the-deed propaganda-by-the-deed") and the anarchist burglars ("</entity/>individual-reappropriation individual-reappropriation") expressed their desperation and their personal, violent rejection of an intolerable society. Moreover, they were clearly meant to be "exemplary" invitations to revolt.". France's </entity/>Bonnot-Gang Bonnot-Gang was the most famous group to embrace illegalism.
However, as soon as 1887, important figures in the anarchist movement distanced themselves from such individual acts. </entity/>Peter-Kropotkin Peter-Kropotkin thus wrote that year in "Le Révolté" that "a structure based on centuries of history cannot be destroyed with a few kilos of dynamite". A variety of anarchists advocated the abandonment of these sorts of tactics in favour of collective revolutionary action, for example through the </entity/>trade-union trade-union movement. The </entity/>anarcho-syndicalism </mention/>anarcho-syndicalist, </entity/>Fernand-Pelloutier Fernand-Pelloutier, argued in 1895 for renewed anarchist involvement in the labour movement on the basis that anarchism could do very well without "the individual dynamiter."
</entity/>Political-repression </mention/>State-repression (including the infamous 1894 French "</entity/>lois-scélérates lois-scélérates") of the anarchist and </entity/>labour-movement labour-movements following the few successful bombings and assassinations may have contributed to the abandonment of these kinds of tactics, although reciprocally state repression, in the first place, may have played a role in these isolated acts. The dismemberment of the French </entity/>socialist-movement socialist-movement, into many groups and, following the suppression of the 1871 </entity/>Paris-Commune Paris-Commune, the execution and exile of many "</entity/>communards communards" to </entity/>penal-colonies penal-colonies, favoured individualist political expression and acts.
Numerous heads of state were assassinated between 1881 and 1914 by members of the anarchist movement. For example, U.S. </entity/>William-McKinley </mention/>President-McKinley's assassin </entity/>Leon-Czolgosz Leon-Czolgosz claimed to have been influenced by anarchist and </entity/>feminist feminist </entity/>Emma-Goldman Emma-Goldman. Bombings were associated in the media with anarchists because </entity/>international-terrorism international-terrorism arose during this time period with the widespread distribution of dynamite. This image remains to this day.
Propaganda of the deed was abandoned by the vast majority of the anarchist movement after World War I (1914–1918) and the </entity/>1917-October-Revolution 1917-October-Revolution.
Russian Revolution and other uprisings of the 1910s.
</entity/>
Anarchists participated alongside the </entity/>Bolshevik Bolsheviks in both </entity/>February-Revolution </mention/>February and </entity/>October-Revolution </mention/>October-revolutions, and were initially enthusiastic about the Bolshevik revolution. However, following a political falling out with the Bolsheviks by the anarchists and other left-wing opposition, the conflict culminated in the 1921 </entity/>Kronstadt-rebellion Kronstadt-rebellion, which the new government repressed. Anarchists in central Russia were either imprisoned, driven underground or joined the victorious Bolsheviks; the anarchists from Petrograd and Moscow fled to the </entity/>Ukraine Ukraine. There, in the </entity/>Free-Territory-(Ukraine) </mention/>Free-Territory, they fought in the </entity/>Russian-Civil-War </mention/>civil-war against the </entity/>White-movement </mention/>Whites (a grouping of monarchists and other opponents of the October Revolution) and then the Bolsheviks as part of the </entity/>Revolutionary-Insurrectionary-Army-of-Ukraine Revolutionary-Insurrectionary-Army-of-Ukraine led by </entity/>Nestor-Makhno Nestor-Makhno, who established an anarchist society in the region for a number of months.
Expelled American anarchists </entity/>Emma-Goldman Emma-Goldman and </entity/>Alexander-Berkman Alexander-Berkman were amongst those agitating in response to Bolshevik policy and the suppression of the </entity/>Kronstadt-rebellion </mention/>Kronstadt-uprising, before they left Russia. Both wrote accounts of their experiences in Russia, criticising the amount of control the Bolsheviks exercised. For them, </entity/>Mikhail-Bakunin </mention/>Bakunin's predictions about the consequences of Marxist rule that the rulers of the new "socialist" Marxist state would become a new elite had proved all too true.
The victory of the Bolsheviks in the October Revolution and the resulting Russian Civil War did serious damage to anarchist movements internationally. Many workers and activists saw Bolshevik success as setting an example; </entity/>Communist-party </mention/>Communist-parties grew at the expense of anarchism and other socialist movements. In France and the United States, for example, members of the major syndicalist movements of the </entity/>Confédération-générale-du-travail </mention/>CGT and </entity/>Industrial-Workers-of-the-World </mention/>IWW left the organisations and joined the </entity/>Comintern </mention/>Communist-International.
The </entity/>Revolutions-of-1917–23 </mention/>revolutionary-wave-of-1917–23 saw the active participation of anarchists in varying degrees of protagonism. In the German uprising known as the </entity/>German-Revolution-of-1918–1919 German-Revolution-of-1918–1919 which established the </entity/>Bavarian-Soviet-Republic Bavarian-Soviet-Republic the anarchists </entity/>Gustav-Landauer Gustav-Landauer, </entity/>Silvio-Gesell Silvio-Gesell and </entity/>Erich-Mühsam Erich-Mühsam had important leadership positions within the revolutionary </entity/>Council-communism </mention/>councilist structures. In the Italian events known as the "</entity/>biennio-rosso biennio-rosso" the anarcho-syndicalist trade union </entity/>Unione-Sindacale-Italiana Unione-Sindacale-Italiana "grew to 800,000 members and the influence of the Italian Anarchist Union (20,000 members plus "</entity/>Umanita-Nova Umanita-Nova", its daily paper) grew accordingly ... Anarchists were the first to suggest occupying workplaces. In the </entity/>Mexican-Revolution Mexican-Revolution the </entity/>Mexican-Liberal-Party Mexican-Liberal-Party was established and during the early 1910s it lead a series of military offensives leading to the conquest and occupation of certain towns and districts in </entity/>Baja-California Baja-California with the leadership of anarcho-communist </entity/>Ricardo-Flores-Magón Ricardo-Flores-Magón.
In Paris, the </entity/>Dielo-Truda Dielo-Truda group of Russian anarchist exiles, which included </entity/>Nestor-Makhno Nestor-Makhno, concluded that anarchists needed to develop new forms of organisation in response to the structures of Bolshevism. Their 1926 manifesto, called the "</entity/>Platformism </mention/>Organisational-Platform-of-the-General-Union-of-Anarchists-(Draft)", was supported. </entity/>Platformist Platformist groups active today include the </entity/>Workers-Solidarity-Movement Workers-Solidarity-Movement in Ireland and the </entity/>NEFAC </mention/>North-Eastern-Federation-of-Anarchist-Communists of North America. </entity/>Synthesis-anarchism Synthesis-anarchism emerged as an organisational alternative to platformism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of </entity/>anarchism-without-adjectives anarchism-without-adjectives. In the 1920s this form found as its main proponents </entity/>Volin Volin and </entity/>Sebastien-Faure Sebastien-Faure. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global </entity/>International-of-Anarchist-Federations International-of-Anarchist-Federations.
Conflicts with European fascist regimes.
</entity/>
In the 1920s and 1930s, the rise of fascism in Europe transformed anarchism's conflict with the state. Italy saw the first struggles between anarchists and fascists. </entity/>Anarchism-in-Italy </mention/>Italian-anarchists played a key role in the </entity/>Anti-fascism </mention/>anti-fascist organisation "</entity/>Arditi-del-Popolo Arditi-del-Popolo", which was strongest in areas with anarchist traditions, and achieved some success in their activism, such as repelling </entity/>Blackshirts Blackshirts in the anarchist stronghold of </entity/>Parma Parma in August 1922. The veteran Italian anarchist, </entity/>Luigi-Fabbri Luigi-Fabbri, was one of the first critical theorists of fascism, describing it as "the preventive counter-revolution." In France, where the </entity/>far-right-leagues far-right-leagues came close to insurrection in the </entity/>6-February-1934-crisis </mention/>February-1934-riots, anarchists divided over a </entity/>united-front united-front policy.
Anarchists in </entity/>Anarchism-in-France </mention/>France and </entity/>Anarchism-in-Italy </mention/>Italy were active in the </entity/>Resistance-during-World-War-II Resistance-during-World-War-II. In Germany the anarchist </entity/>Erich-Mühsam Erich-Mühsam was arrested on charges unknown in the early morning hours of 28 February 1933, within a few hours after the </entity/>Reichstag-fire Reichstag-fire in Berlin. </entity/>Joseph-Goebbels Joseph-Goebbels, the Nazi </entity/>Propagandaministerium </mention/>propaganda-minister, labelled him as one of "those Jewish subversives." Over the next seventeen months, he would be imprisoned in the concentration camps at </entity/>Sonnenburg Sonnenburg, Brandenburg and finally, </entity/>Oranienburg Oranienburg. On 2 February 1934, Mühsam was transferred to the </entity/>Nazi-concentration-camps </mention/>concentration-camp at </entity/>Oranienburg-concentration-camp </mention/>Oranienburg when finally on the night of 9 July 1934, Mühsam was tortured and murdered by the guards, his battered corpse found hanging in a latrine the next morning.
Spanish Revolution.
In Spain, the national anarcho-syndicalist trade union </entity/>Confederación-Nacional-del-Trabajo Confederación-Nacional-del-Trabajo initially refused to join a popular front electoral alliance, and abstention by CNT supporters led to a right wing election victory. But in 1936, the CNT changed its policy and anarchist votes helped bring the popular front back to power. Months later, the former ruling class responded with an attempted coup causing the </entity/>Spanish-Civil-War Spanish-Civil-War (1936–1939). In response to the army rebellion, an </entity/>Anarchism-in-Spain </mention/>anarchist-inspired movement of peasants and workers, supported by armed militias, took control of </entity/>Barcelona Barcelona and of large areas of rural Spain where they </entity/>Collective-farming </mention/>collectivised the land. But even before the fascist victory in 1939, the anarchists were losing ground in a bitter struggle with the </entity/>Stalinism </mention/>Stalinists, who controlled much of the distribution of military aid to the Republican cause from the </entity/>Soviet-Union Soviet-Union. The events known as the Spanish Revolution was a workers' </entity/>social-revolution social-revolution that began during the outbreak of the </entity/>Spanish-Civil-War Spanish-Civil-War in 1936 and resulted in the widespread implementation of </entity/>Anarchism-in-Spain </mention/>anarchist and more broadly </entity/>libertarian-socialist libertarian-socialist organisational principles throughout various portions of the country for two to three years, primarily </entity/>Catalonia Catalonia, Aragon, </entity/>Andalusia Andalusia, and parts of </entity/>Levante,-Spain </mention/>the-Levante. Much of </entity/>Spain's-economy Spain's-economy was put under worker control; in anarchist strongholds like </entity/>Catalonia Catalonia, the figure was as high as 75%, but lower in areas with heavy </entity/>Communist-Party-of-Spain-(main) </mention/>Communist-Party-of-Spain influence, as the </entity/>Soviet-Union </mention/>Soviet-allied party actively resisted attempts at </entity/>collectivization collectivization enactment. Factories were run through worker committees, </entity/>agriculture </mention/>agrarian areas became collectivised and run as </entity/>Libertarian-socialism </mention/>libertarian </entity/>commune-(intentional-community) </mention/>communes. Anarchist historian </entity/>Sam-Dolgoff Sam-Dolgoff estimated that about eight million people participated directly or at least indirectly in the Spanish Revolution, which he claimed "came closer to realizing the ideal of the free stateless society on a vast scale than any other revolution in history."
</entity/>Stalinist-purges </mention/>Stalinist-led troops suppressed the collectives and persecuted both </entity/>Workers'-Party-of-Marxist-Unification </mention/>dissident-Marxists and anarchists. The prominent Italian anarchist </entity/>Camillo-Berneri Camillo-Berneri, who volunteered to fight against Franco was killed instead in Spain by gunmen associated with the </entity/>Spanish-Communist-Party Spanish-Communist-Party.
Post-war years.
</entity/> Anarchism sought to reorganise itself after the war and in this context the organisational debate between </entity/>synthesis-anarchism synthesis-anarchism and </entity/>platformism platformism took importance once again especially in the </entity/>Anarchism-in-Italy#Postwar-years-and-today </mention/>anarchist-movements-of-Italy and </entity/>Anarchism-in-France#The-Fourth-Republic-(1945–1958) </mention/>France. The </entity/>Mexican-Anarchist-Federation Mexican-Anarchist-Federation was established in 1945 after the Anarchist Federation of the Centre united with the Anarchist Federation of the Federal District. In the early 1940s, the Antifascist International Solidarity and the Federation of Anarchist Groups of Cuba merged into the large national organisation Asociación Libertaria de Cuba (Cuban Libertarian Association). From 1944 to 1947, the Bulgarian Anarchist Communist Federation reemerged as part of a factory and workplace committee movement, but was repressed by the new Communist regime. In 1945 in </entity/>Anarchism-in-France </mention/>France the </entity/>Fédération-Anarchiste Fédération-Anarchiste and the anarchosyndicalist trade union </entity/>Confédération-nationale-du-travail Confédération-nationale-du-travail was established in the next year while the also </entity/>Synthesist-anarchism </mention/>synthesist </entity/>Federazione-Anarchica-Italiana Federazione-Anarchica-Italiana was founded in </entity/>Anarchism-in-Italy </mention/>Italy. Korean anarchists formed the League of Free Social Constructors in September 1945 and in 1946 the </entity/>Japanese-Anarchist-Federation Japanese-Anarchist-Federation was founded. An International Anarchist Congress with delegates from across Europe was held in Paris in May 1948. After World War II, an appeal in the "</entity/>Fraye-Arbeter-Shtime Fraye-Arbeter-Shtime" detailing the plight of </entity/>Anarchism-in-Germany </mention/>German-anarchists and called for Americans to support them. By February 1946, the sending of aid parcels to anarchists in Germany was a large-scale operation. The Federation of Libertarian Socialists was founded in Germany in 1947 and </entity/>Rudolf-Rocker Rudolf-Rocker wrote for its organ, "Die Freie Gesellschaft", which survived until 1953. In 1956 the </entity/>Uruguayan-Anarchist-Federation Uruguayan-Anarchist-Federation was founded. In 1955 the Anarcho-Communist Federation of Argentina renamed itself as the </entity/>Argentine-Libertarian-Federation Argentine-Libertarian-Federation. The </entity/>Syndicalist-Workers'-Federation Syndicalist-Workers'-Federation was a syndicalist group in active in post-war Britain, and one of </entity/>Solidarity-Federation Solidarity-Federation's earliest predecessors. It was formed in 1950 by members of the dissolved Anarchist Federation of Britain. Unlike the AFB, which was influenced by anarcho-syndicalist ideas but ultimately not syndicalist itself, the SWF decided to pursue a more definitely </entity/>syndicalism </mention/>syndicalist, worker-centred strategy from the outset.
Anarchism continued to influence important literary and intellectual personalities of the time, such as </entity/>Albert-Camus Albert-Camus, </entity/>Herbert-Read Herbert-Read, </entity/>Paul-Goodman-(writer) </mention/>Paul-Goodman, </entity/>Dwight-Macdonald Dwight-Macdonald, </entity/>Allen-Ginsberg Allen-Ginsberg, </entity/>George-Woodcock George-Woodcock, </entity/>Leopold-Kohr Leopold-Kohr, </entity/>Julian-Beck Julian-Beck, </entity/>John-Cage John-Cage and the French </entity/>Surrealism </mention/>Surrealist group led by </entity/>André-Breton André-Breton, which now openly embraced anarchism and collaborated in the </entity/>Fédération-Anarchiste Fédération-Anarchiste.
</entity/>Anarcho-pacifism Anarcho-pacifism became influential in the </entity/>Anti-nuclear-movement Anti-nuclear-movement and </entity/>anti-war-movement anti-war-movements of the time as can be seen in the activism and writings of the English anarchist member of </entity/>Campaign-for-Nuclear-Disarmament Campaign-for-Nuclear-Disarmament </entity/>Alex-Comfort Alex-Comfort or the similar activism of the American catholic anarcho-pacifists </entity/>Ammon-Hennacy Ammon-Hennacy and </entity/>Dorothy-Day Dorothy-Day. Anarcho-pacifism became a "basis for a critique of militarism on both sides of the </entity/>Cold-War Cold-War." The resurgence of anarchist ideas during this period is well documented in Robert Graham's </entity/>, "Volume Two: The Emergence of the New Anarchism (1939–1977)".
Contemporary anarchism.
</entity/> A surge of popular interest in anarchism occurred in western nations during the 1960s and 1970s. Anarchism was influential in the </entity/>Counterculture-of-the-1960s Counterculture-of-the-1960s and anarchists actively participated in the </entity/>Protests-of-1968 </mention/>late-sixties-students-and-workers-revolts. In 1968 in </entity/>Carrara Carrara, Italy the </entity/>International-of-Anarchist-Federations International-of-Anarchist-Federations was founded during an international anarchist conference held there in 1968 by the three existing European federations of France (the </entity/>Fédération-anarchiste </mention/>Fédération-Anarchiste), the </entity/>Federazione-Anarchica-Italiana Federazione-Anarchica-Italiana of Italy and the </entity/>Iberian-Anarchist-Federation Iberian-Anarchist-Federation as well as the </entity/>Bulgaria Bulgarian federation in French exile.
In the United Kingdom in the 1970s this was associated with the </entity/>punk-rock punk-rock movement, as exemplified by bands such as </entity/>Crass Crass and the </entity/>Sex-Pistols Sex-Pistols. The housing and employment crisis in most of Western Europe led to the formation of </entity/>commune-(intentional-community) </mention/>communes and </entity/>Squatting </mention/>squatter movements like that of </entity/>Barcelona Barcelona, Spain. In Denmark, </entity/>squatter squatters occupied a disused military base and declared the </entity/>Freetown-Christiania Freetown-Christiania, an autonomous haven in central Copenhagen. Since the revival of anarchism in the mid 20th century, a number of new movements and schools of thought emerged. Although feminist tendencies have always been a part of the anarchist movement in the form of </entity/>anarcha-feminism anarcha-feminism, they returned with vigour during the second wave of feminism in the 1960s. Anarchist anthropologist </entity/>David-Graeber David-Graeber and anarchist historian </entity/>Andrej-Grubacic Andrej-Grubacic have posited a rupture between generations of anarchism, with those "who often still have not shaken the sectarian habits" of the 19th century contrasted with the younger activists who are "much more informed, among other elements, by </entity/>Traditional-knowledge </mention/>indigenous, </entity/>feminism </mention/>feminist, ecological and </entity/>counterculture </mention/>cultural-critical ideas", and who by the turn of the 21st century formed "by far the majority" of anarchists.
Around the turn of the 21st century, anarchism grew in popularity and influence as part of the anti-war, anti-capitalist, and </entity/>anti-globalisation-movement anti-globalisation-movements. Anarchists became known for their involvement in protests against the meetings of the </entity/>World-Trade-Organization World-Trade-Organization (WTO), </entity/>G8 </mention/>Group-of-Eight, and the </entity/>World-Economic-Forum World-Economic-Forum. Some anarchist factions at these protests engaged in rioting, property destruction, and violent confrontations with police. These actions were precipitated by ad hoc, leaderless, anonymous cadres known as "</entity/>black-bloc black-blocs"; other organisational tactics pioneered in this time include </entity/>security-culture security-culture, </entity/>affinity-groups affinity-groups and the use of decentralised technologies such as the internet. A significant event of this period was the confrontations at </entity/>World-Trade-Organization-Ministerial-Conference-of-1999-protest-activity </mention/>WTO-conference-in-Seattle-in-1999. According to anarchist scholar </entity/>Simon-Critchley Simon-Critchley, "contemporary anarchism can be seen as a powerful critique of the pseudo-libertarianism of contemporary </entity/>neo-liberalism neo-liberalism ... One might say that contemporary anarchism is about responsibility, whether sexual, ecological or socio-economic; it flows from an experience of conscience about the manifold ways in which the West ravages the rest; it is an ethical outrage at the yawning inequality, impoverishment and disenfranchisment that is so palpable locally and globally."
International anarchist federations in existence include the </entity/>International-of-Anarchist-Federations International-of-Anarchist-Federations, the </entity/>International-Workers'-Association International-Workers'-Association, and </entity/>International-Libertarian-Solidarity International-Libertarian-Solidarity.
The largest organised anarchist movement today is in Spain, in the form of the </entity/>Confederación-General-del-Trabajo Confederación-General-del-Trabajo (CGT) and the </entity/>Confederación-Nacional-del-Trabajo </mention/>CNT. CGT membership was estimated at around 100,000 for 2003. Other active syndicalist movements include in Sweden the </entity/>Central-Organisation-of-the-Workers-of-Sweden Central-Organisation-of-the-Workers-of-Sweden and the </entity/>Swedish-Anarcho-syndicalist-Youth-Federation Swedish-Anarcho-syndicalist-Youth-Federation; the CNT-AIT in France; the </entity/>Unione-Sindacale-Italiana </mention/>Union-Sindicale-Italiana in Italy; in the US </entity/>Workers-Solidarity-Alliance Workers-Solidarity-Alliance and the UK </entity/>Solidarity-Federation Solidarity-Federation and </entity/>Anarchist-Federation-(Britain-and-Ireland) </mention/>Anarchist-Federation. The revolutionary industrial unionist </entity/>Industrial-Workers-of-the-World Industrial-Workers-of-the-World, claiming 2,000 paying members, and the </entity/>International-Workers-Association International-Workers-Association, an anarcho-syndicalist successor to the First International, also remain active.
</entity/>
Anarchist schools of thought.
</entity/>
Anarchist schools of thought had been generally grouped in two main historical traditions, </entity/>individualist-anarchism individualist-anarchism and </entity/>social-anarchism social-anarchism, which have some different origins, values and evolution. The individualist wing of anarchism emphasises </entity/>negative-liberty negative-liberty, i.e. opposition to state or </entity/>social-control social-control over the individual, while those in the social wing emphasise </entity/>positive-liberty positive-liberty to achieve one's potential and argue that humans have needs that society ought to fulfill, "recognizing equality of entitlement". In a chronological and theoretical sense, there are classical – those created throughout the 19th century – and post-classical anarchist schools – those created since the mid-20th century and after.
Beyond the specific factions of anarchist thought is </entity/>philosophical-anarchism philosophical-anarchism, which embodies the theoretical stance that the </entity/>state-(polity) </mention/>state lacks moral legitimacy without accepting the imperative of revolution to eliminate it. A component especially of individualist anarchism philosophical anarchism may accept the existence of a </entity/>minarchism </mention/>minimal-state as unfortunate, and usually temporary, "necessary evil" but argue that citizens do not have a </entity/>moral-obligation moral-obligation to obey the state when its laws conflict with individual autonomy. One reaction against sectarianism within the anarchist milieu was "</entity/>anarchism-without-adjectives anarchism-without-adjectives", a call for </entity/>toleration toleration first adopted by </entity/>Fernando-Tarrida-del-Mármol Fernando-Tarrida-del-Mármol in 1889 in response to the "bitter debates" of anarchist theory at the time. In abandoning the hyphenated anarchisms (i.e. collectivist-, communist-, mutualist– and individualist-anarchism), it sought to emphasise the </entity/>anti-authoritarian anti-authoritarian beliefs common to all anarchist schools of thought.
Classical anarchist schools of thought.
Mutualism.
Mutualism began in 18th-century English and French labour movements before taking an anarchist form associated with </entity/>Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon in France and others in the United States. Proudhon proposed </entity/>spontaneous-order spontaneous-order, whereby organisation emerges without central authority, a "positive anarchy" where order arises when everybody does "what he wishes and only what he wishes" and where "business transactions alone produce the social order." It is important to recognize that Proudhon distinguished between ideal political possibilities and practical governance. For this reason, much in contrast to some of his theoretical statements concerning ultimate spontaneous self-governance, Proudhon was heavily involved in French parliamentary politics and allied himself not with Anarchist but Socialist factions of workers movements and, in addition to advocating state-protected charters for worker-owned cooperatives, promoted certain nationalization schemes during his life of public service.
Mutualist anarchism is concerned with </entity/>Reciprocity-(cultural-anthropology) </mention/>reciprocity, free association, voluntary contract, federation, and credit and currency reform. According to the American mutualist </entity/>William-Batchelder-Greene William-Batchelder-Greene, each worker in the mutualist system would receive "just and exact pay for his work; services equivalent in cost being exchangeable for services equivalent in cost, without profit or discount." Mutualism has been retrospectively characterised as ideologically situated between individualist and collectivist forms of anarchism. Proudhon first characterised his goal as a "third form of society, the synthesis of communism and property."
Individualist anarchism.
Individualist anarchism refers to several traditions of thought within the anarchist movement that emphasize the </entity/>individual individual and their </entity/>will-(philosophy) </mention/>will over any kinds of external determinants such as groups, society, traditions, and ideological systems. Individualist anarchism is not a single philosophy but refers to a group of individualistic philosophies that sometimes are in conflict.
In 1793, </entity/>William-Godwin William-Godwin, who has often been cited as the first anarchist, wrote "</entity/>Political-Justice Political-Justice", which some consider the first expression of anarchism. Godwin, a philosophical anarchist, from a </entity/>rationalist rationalist and </entity/>utilitarian utilitarian basis opposed revolutionary action and saw a </entity/>Limited-government </mention/>minimal-state as a present "necessary evil" that would become increasingly irrelevant and powerless by the gradual spread of knowledge. Godwin advocated </entity/>individualism individualism, proposing that all cooperation in labour be eliminated on the premise that this would be most conducive with the general good.
</entity/>
An influential form of individualist anarchism, called "egoism," or </entity/>egoist-anarchism egoist-anarchism, was expounded by one of the earliest and best-known proponents of individualist anarchism, the German </entity/>Max-Stirner Max-Stirner. Stirner's "</entity/>The-Ego-and-Its-Own The-Ego-and-Its-Own", published in 1844, is a founding text of the philosophy. According to Stirner, the only limitation on the rights of the individual is their power to obtain what they desire, without regard for God, state, or morality. To Stirner, rights were "</entity/>Reification-(fallacy) </mention/>spooks" in the mind, and he held that society does not exist but "the individuals are its reality". Stirner advocated self-assertion and foresaw </entity/>union-of-egoists </mention/>unions-of-egoists, non-systematic associations continually renewed by all parties' support through an act of will, which Stirner proposed as a form of organisation in place of the </entity/>state-(polity) </mention/>state. Egoist anarchists argue that egoism will foster genuine and spontaneous union between individuals. "Egoism" has inspired many interpretations of Stirner's philosophy. It was re-discovered and promoted by German philosophical anarchist and </entity/>LGBT LGBT activist </entity/>John-Henry-Mackay John-Henry-Mackay.
</entity/>Josiah-Warren Josiah-Warren is widely regarded as the first American anarchist, and the four-page weekly paper he edited during 1833, "The Peaceful Revolutionist", was the first anarchist periodical published. For American anarchist historian Eunice Minette Schuster "It is apparent ... that </entity/>Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon </mention/>Proudhonian Anarchism was to be found in the United States at least as early as 1848 and that it was not conscious of its affinity to the Individualist Anarchism of </entity/>Josiah-Warren Josiah-Warren and </entity/>Stephen-Pearl-Andrews Stephen-Pearl-Andrews ... </entity/>William-B.-Greene William-B.-Greene presented this Proudhonian Mutualism in its purest and most systematic form.". </entity/>Henry-David-Thoreau Henry-David-Thoreau (1817–1862) was an important early influence in individualist anarchist thought in the United States and Europe. Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, </entity/>Development-criticism </mention/>development-critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading </entity/>transcendentalist transcendentalist. He is best known for his books "</entity/>Walden Walden", a reflection upon </entity/>simple-living simple-living in natural surroundings, and his essay, "</entity/>Civil-Disobedience-(Thoreau) </mention/>Civil-Disobedience", an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. Later </entity/>Benjamin-Tucker Benjamin-Tucker fused Stirner's egoism with the economics of Warren and Proudhon in his eclectic influential publication "</entity/>Liberty-(1881–1908) </mention/>Liberty".
From these early influences individualist anarchism in different countries attracted a small but diverse following of bohemian artists and intellectuals, </entity/>free-love free-love and </entity/>birth-control birth-control advocates (see </entity/>Anarchism-and-issues-related-to-love-and-sex Anarchism-and-issues-related-to-love-and-sex), individualist </entity/>Naturism </mention/>naturists </entity/>Nudism </mention/>nudists (see </entity/>anarcho-naturism anarcho-naturism), </entity/>freethought freethought and </entity/>Anti-clericalism </mention/>anti-clerical activists as well as young anarchist outlaws in what became known as </entity/>illegalism illegalism and </entity/>individual-reclamation individual-reclamation (see </entity/>European-individualist-anarchism European-individualist-anarchism and </entity/>individualist-anarchism-in-France individualist-anarchism-in-France). These authors and activists included </entity/>Oscar-Wilde Oscar-Wilde, </entity/>Emile-Armand Emile-Armand, </entity/>Han-Ryner Han-Ryner, </entity/>Henri-Zisly Henri-Zisly, </entity/>Renzo-Novatore Renzo-Novatore, </entity/>Miguel-Gimenez-Igualada Miguel-Gimenez-Igualada, </entity/>Adolf-Brand Adolf-Brand and </entity/>Lev-Chernyi Lev-Chernyi among others.
Social anarchism.
Social anarchism calls for a system with common ownership of means of production and democratic control of all organisations, without any government authority or </entity/>coercion coercion. It is the largest school of thought in anarchism. Social anarchism rejects private property, seeing it as a source of social inequality (while retaining respect for </entity/>personal-property personal-property), and emphasises cooperation and </entity/>mutual-aid-(organization) </mention/>mutual-aid.
Collectivist anarchism.
Collectivist anarchism, also referred to as "revolutionary socialism" or a form of such, is a revolutionary form of anarchism, commonly associated with </entity/>Mikhail-Bakunin Mikhail-Bakunin and </entity/>Johann-Most Johann-Most. Collectivist anarchists oppose all private ownership of the means of production, instead advocating that ownership be collectivised. This was to be achieved through violent revolution, first starting with a small cohesive group through acts of violence, or "</entity/>propaganda-by-the-deed propaganda-by-the-deed", which would inspire the workers as a whole to revolt and forcibly collectivise the means of production.
However, collectivization was not to be extended to the distribution of income, as workers would be paid according to time worked, rather than receiving goods being distributed "according to need" as in anarcho-communism. This position was criticised by </entity/>anarchist-communists anarchist-communists as effectively "uphold[ing] the wages system". Collectivist anarchism arose contemporaneously with </entity/>Marxism Marxism but opposed the Marxist </entity/>dictatorship-of-the-proletariat dictatorship-of-the-proletariat, despite the stated Marxist goal of a collectivist stateless society. Anarchist, communist and collectivist ideas are not </entity/>mutually-exclusive mutually-exclusive; although the collectivist anarchists advocated compensation for labour, some held out the possibility of a post-revolutionary transition to a communist system of distribution according to need.
Anarcho-communism.
Anarchist communism (also known as anarcho-communism, libertarian communism and occasionally as free communism) is a theory of anarchism that advocates abolition of the </entity/>State-(polity) </mention/>state, </entity/>markets markets, money, </entity/>private-property private-property (while retaining respect for </entity/>personal-property personal-property), and capitalism in favour of </entity/>common-ownership common-ownership of the </entity/>means-of-production means-of-production, </entity/>direct-democracy direct-democracy and a horizontal network of </entity/>voluntary-association voluntary-associations and </entity/>workers'-council workers'-councils with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: "</entity/>from-each-according-to-his-ability,-to-each-according-to-his-need from-each-according-to-his-ability,-to-each-according-to-his-need".
</entity/>
Some forms of anarchist communism such as </entity/>insurrectionary-anarchism insurrectionary-anarchism are strongly influenced by </entity/>egoist-anarchism </mention/>egoism and radical </entity/>individualism individualism, believing anarcho-communism is the best social system for the realization of individual freedom. Most anarcho-communists view anarcho-communism as a way of reconciling the opposition between the individual and society.
Anarcho-communism developed out of radical socialist currents after the French revolution but was first formulated as such in the Italian section of the </entity/>First-International First-International. The theoretical work of </entity/>Peter-Kropotkin Peter-Kropotkin took importance later as it expanded and developed pro-organisationalist and </entity/>Insurrectionary-anarchism </mention/>insurrectionary-anti-organisationalist sections. To date, the best known examples of an anarchist communist society (i.e., established around the ideas as they exist today and achieving worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon), are the anarchist territories during the </entity/>Spanish-Revolution Spanish-Revolution and the </entity/>Free-Territory Free-Territory during the </entity/>Russian-Revolution-(1917) </mention/>Russian-Revolution. Through the efforts and influence of the </entity/>Spanish-Anarchists Spanish-Anarchists during the </entity/>Spanish-Revolution Spanish-Revolution within the </entity/>Spanish-Civil-War Spanish-Civil-War, starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of </entity/>Anarchist-Catalonia Anarchist-Catalonia before being crushed by the combined forces of </entity/>Francoism </mention/>the-regime-that-won-the-war, </entity/>Adolf-Hitler </mention/>Hitler, Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as </entity/>Nestor-Makhno Nestor-Makhno worked to create and defend – through the </entity/>Revolutionary-Insurrectionary-Army-of-Ukraine Revolutionary-Insurrectionary-Army-of-Ukraine – anarchist communism in the </entity/>Free-Territory Free-Territory of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.
Anarcho-syndicalism.
</entity/>Anarcho-syndicalism is a branch of anarchism that focuses on the </entity/>trade-union </mention/>labour-movement. Anarcho-syndicalists view </entity/>trade-union </mention/>labour-unions as a potential force for revolutionary social change, replacing capitalism and the </entity/>State-(polity) </mention/>state with a new society democratically self-managed by workers. The basic principles of anarcho-syndicalism are: Workers' </entity/>wikt:Solidarity </mention/>solidarity, </entity/>Direct-action Direct-action and </entity/>Workers'-self-management Workers'-self-management
Anarcho-syndicalists believe that only </entity/>direct-action direct-action – that is, action concentrated on directly attaining a goal, as opposed to indirect action, such as electing a representative to a government position – will allow workers to liberate themselves. Moreover, anarcho-syndicalists believe that workers' organisations (the organisations that struggle against the wage system, which, in anarcho-syndicalist theory, will eventually form the basis of a new society) should be self-managing. They should not have bosses or "business agents"; rather, the workers should be able to make all the decisions that affect them themselves. </entity/>Rudolf-Rocker Rudolf-Rocker was one of the most popular voices in the anarcho-syndicalist movement. He outlined a view of the origins of the movement, what it sought, and why it was important to the future of labour in his 1938 pamphlet "Anarcho-Syndicalism".The </entity/>International-Workers-Association International-Workers-Association is an international anarcho-syndicalist federation of various labour unions from different countries. The Spanish </entity/>Confederación-Nacional-del-Trabajo Confederación-Nacional-del-Trabajo played and still plays a major role in the Spanish </entity/>labour-movement labour-movement. It was also an important force in the </entity/>Spanish-Civil-War Spanish-Civil-War.
Post-classical schools of thought.
</entity/>
Anarchism continues to generate many philosophies and movements, at times eclectic, drawing upon various sources, and </entity/>Syncretic-politics </mention/>syncretic, combining disparate concepts to create new philosophical approaches.
</entity/>Green-anarchism Green-anarchism (or eco-anarchism) is a school of thought within anarchism that emphasizes environmental issues, with an important precedent in </entity/>anarcho-naturism anarcho-naturism, and whose main contemporary currents are </entity/>anarcho-primitivism anarcho-primitivism and </entity/>social-ecology social-ecology.
</entity/>Anarcha-feminism Anarcha-feminism (also called anarchist feminism and anarcho-feminism) combines anarchism with </entity/>feminism feminism. It generally views </entity/>patriarchy patriarchy as a manifestation of involuntary </entity/>Coercion </mention/>coercive hierarchy that should be replaced by </entity/>decentralised decentralised </entity/>Free-association-(communism-and-anarchism) </mention/>free-association. Anarcha-feminists believe that the struggle against patriarchy is an essential part of </entity/>class-struggle class-struggle, and the anarchist struggle against the </entity/>State-(polity) </mention/>state. In essence, the philosophy sees anarchist struggle as a necessary component of feminist struggle and vice-versa. </entity/>L.-Susan-Brown L.-Susan-Brown claims that "as anarchism is a political philosophy that opposes all relationships of power, it is inherently feminist". Anarcha-feminism began with the late 19th century writings of early feminist anarchists such as </entity/>Emma-Goldman Emma-Goldman and </entity/>Voltairine-de-Cleyre Voltairine-de-Cleyre.
</entity/>Anarcho-pacifism Anarcho-pacifism is a tendency that rejects violence in the struggle for social change (see </entity/>non-violence non-violence). It developed "mostly in the </entity/>Netherlands Netherlands, Britain, and the United States, before and during the Second World War". </entity/>Christian-anarchism Christian-anarchism is a </entity/>Christian-movement </mention/>movement in </entity/>political-theology political-theology that combines anarchism and Christianity. Its main proponents included </entity/>Leo-Tolstoy Leo-Tolstoy, </entity/>Dorothy-Day Dorothy-Day, </entity/>Ammon-Hennacy Ammon-Hennacy, and </entity/>Jacques-Ellul Jacques-Ellul.
</entity/>Platformism Platformism is a tendency within the wider anarchist movement based on the organisational theories in the tradition of </entity/>Dielo-Truda Dielo-Truda's "Organisational Platform of the General Union of Anarchists (Draft)". The document was based on the experiences of </entity/>Anarchism-in-Russia </mention/>Russian-anarchists in the 1917 </entity/>October-Revolution October-Revolution, which led eventually to the victory of the </entity/>Bolsheviks Bolsheviks over the anarchists and other groups. The "Platform" attempted to address and explain the anarchist movement's failures during the </entity/>Russian-Revolution-(1917) </mention/>Russian-Revolution.
</entity/>Synthesis-anarchism Synthesis-anarchism is a form of anarchism that tries to join anarchists of different tendencies under the principles of </entity/>anarchism-without-adjectives anarchism-without-adjectives. In the 1920s, this form found as its main proponents the </entity/>anarcho-communists anarcho-communists </entity/>Voline Voline and </entity/>Sébastien-Faure Sébastien-Faure. It is the main principle behind the anarchist federations grouped around the contemporary global </entity/>International-of-Anarchist-Federations International-of-Anarchist-Federations.
</entity/>Post-left-anarchy Post-left-anarchy is a recent current in anarchist thought that promotes a critique of anarchism's relationship to traditional </entity/>Left-wing-politics Left-wing-politics. Some post-leftists seek to escape the confines of </entity/>ideology ideology in general also presenting a critique of organisations and </entity/>morality morality. Influenced by the work of </entity/>Max-Stirner Max-Stirner and by the Marxist </entity/>Situationist-International Situationist-International, post-left anarchy is marked by a focus on social </entity/>insurrectionary-anarchism </mention/>insurrection and a rejection of leftist social organisation.
</entity/>Insurrectionary-anarchism Insurrectionary-anarchism is a revolutionary theory, practice, and tendency within the anarchist movement which emphasizes </entity/>insurrection insurrection within anarchist practice. It is critical of formal organisations such as </entity/>labour-unions labour-unions and federations that are based on a political programme and periodic congresses. Instead, insurrectionary anarchists advocate informal organisation and small </entity/>affinity-group affinity-group based organisation. Insurrectionary anarchists put value in attack, permanent </entity/>class-conflict class-conflict, and a refusal to negotiate or compromise with class enemies.
</entity/>Post-anarchism Post-anarchism is a theoretical move towards a synthesis of classical anarchist theory and </entity/>poststructuralist poststructuralist thought, drawing from diverse ideas including </entity/>post-modernism post-modernism, </entity/>autonomist-marxism autonomist-marxism, </entity/>post-left-anarchy post-left-anarchy, </entity/>Situationist-International Situationist-International, and </entity/>postcolonialism postcolonialism.
</entity/>Left-wing-market-anarchism Left-wing-market-anarchism strongly affirm the classical liberal ideas of self-ownership and free markets, while maintaining that, taken to their logical conclusions, these ideas support strongly anti-corporatist, anti-hierarchical, pro-labor positions and anti-capitalism in economics and anti-imperialism in foreign policy.
</entity/>Anarcho-capitalism Anarcho-capitalism advocates the elimination of the </entity/>state-(polity) </mention/>state in favour of </entity/>sovereign-individual </mention/>individual-sovereignty in a </entity/>free-market free-market. Anarcho-capitalism developed from radical anti-state </entity/>libertarianism libertarianism and </entity/>individualist-anarchism individualist-anarchism, drawing from </entity/>Austrian-School Austrian-School economics, study of </entity/>law-and-economics law-and-economics, and </entity/>public-choice-theory public-choice-theory. There is a strong current within anarchism which does not consider that anarcho-capitalism can be considered a part of the anarchist movement due to the fact that anarchism has historically been an </entity/>anti-capitalist anti-capitalist movement and for definitional reasons which see anarchism incompatible with capitalist forms.
Internal issues and debates.
</entity/>
Anarchism is a </entity/>philosophy philosophy that embodies many diverse attitudes, tendencies and schools of thought; as such, disagreement over questions of values, ideology and tactics is common. The compatibility of </entity/>anarchism-and-capitalism </mention/>capitalism, </entity/>anarchism-and-nationalism </mention/>nationalism, and </entity/>anarchism-and-religion </mention/>religion with anarchism is widely disputed. Similarly, anarchism enjoys complex relationships with ideologies such as </entity/>Anarchism-and-Marxism </mention/>Marxism, </entity/>Issues-in-anarchism#Communism </mention/>communism and </entity/>Anarchism-and-capitalism </mention/>capitalism. Anarchists may be motivated by </entity/>humanism humanism, </entity/>Christian-anarchism </mention/>divine-authority, </entity/>enlightened-self-interest enlightened-self-interest, </entity/>veganarchism </mention/>veganism or any number of alternative ethical doctrines.
Phenomena such as </entity/>civilization civilization, </entity/>technology technology (e.g. within </entity/>anarcho-primitivism anarcho-primitivism and </entity/>insurrectionary-anarchism insurrectionary-anarchism), and </entity/>Issues-in-anarchism#Participation-in-statist-democracy </mention/>the-democratic-process may be sharply criticised within some anarchist tendencies and simultaneously lauded in others.
On a tactical level, while </entity/>propaganda-of-the-deed propaganda-of-the-deed was a tactic used by anarchists in the 19th century (e.g. the </entity/>Nihilist-movement Nihilist-movement), some contemporary anarchists espouse alternative </entity/>direct-action direct-action methods such as </entity/>nonviolence nonviolence, </entity/>counter-economics counter-economics and </entity/>Crypto-anarchism </mention/>anti-state-cryptography to bring about an anarchist society. About the scope of an anarchist society, some anarchists advocate a global one, while others do so by local ones. The diversity in anarchism has led to widely different use of identical terms among different anarchist traditions, which has led to many </entity/>definitional-concerns-in-anarchist-theory definitional-concerns-in-anarchist-theory.
Topics of interest.
Intersecting and overlapping between various schools of thought, certain topics of interest and internal disputes have proven perennial within anarchist theory.
Free love.
</entity/>
An important current within anarchism is </entity/>free-love free-love. Free love advocates sometimes traced their roots back to </entity/>Josiah-Warren Josiah-Warren and to experimental communities, viewed sexual freedom as a clear, direct expression of an individual's self-ownership. Free love particularly stressed </entity/>women's-rights women's-rights since most sexual laws discriminated against women: for example, marriage laws and anti-birth control measures. The most important American free love journal was "</entity/>Lucifer-the-Lightbearer Lucifer-the-Lightbearer" (1883–1907) edited by </entity/>Moses-Harman Moses-Harman and </entity/>Lois-Waisbrooker Lois-Waisbrooker, but also there existed </entity/>Ezra-Heywood Ezra-Heywood and Angela Heywood's "</entity/>The-Word-(free-love) </mention/>The-Word" (1872–1890, 1892–1893). "</entity/>Free-Society Free-Society" (1895–1897 as "The Firebrand"; 1897–1904 as "Free Society") was a major anarchist newspaper in the United States at the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th centuries. The publication advocated </entity/>free-love free-love and </entity/>women's-rights women's-rights, and critiqued "</entity/>Comstockery Comstockery" – censorship of sexual information. Also </entity/>M.-E.-Lazarus M.-E.-Lazarus was an important American individualist anarchist who promoted free love.
In New York City's </entity/>Greenwich-Village Greenwich-Village, </entity/>Bohemianism </mention/>bohemian feminists and socialists advocated self-realisation and pleasure for women (and also men) in the here and now. They encouraged playing with sexual roles and sexuality, and the openly bisexual radical </entity/>Edna-St.-Vincent-Millay Edna-St.-Vincent-Millay and the lesbian anarchist </entity/>Margaret-Anderson Margaret-Anderson were prominent among them. Discussion groups organised by the Villagers were frequented by </entity/>Emma-Goldman Emma-Goldman, among others. Magnus Hirschfeld noted in 1923 that Goldman "has campaigned boldly and steadfastly for individual rights, and especially for those deprived of their rights. Thus it came about that she was the first and only woman, indeed the first and only American, to take up the defense of homosexual love before the general public." In fact, before Goldman, </entity/>heterosexual heterosexual anarchist Robert Reitzel (1849–1898) spoke positively of homosexuality from the beginning of the 1890s in his Detroit-based German language journal "Der arme Teufel". In Argentina anarcha-feminist </entity/>Virginia-Bolten Virginia-Bolten published the newspaper called "" (), which was published nine times in Rosario between 8 January 1896 and 1 January 1897, and was revived, briefly, in 1901.
In Europe the main propagandist of free love within individualist anarchism was </entity/>Emile-Armand Emile-Armand. He proposed the concept of "la camaraderie amoureuse" to speak of free love as the possibility of voluntary sexual encounter between consenting adults. He was also a consistent proponent of </entity/>polyamory polyamory. In Germany the </entity/>stirner stirnerists </entity/>Adolf-Brand Adolf-Brand and </entity/>John-Henry-Mackay John-Henry-Mackay were pioneering campaigners for the acceptance of male </entity/>bisexuality bisexuality and </entity/>homosexuality homosexuality. </entity/>Mujeres-Libres Mujeres-Libres was an anarchist women's organisation in Spain that aimed to empower working class women. It was founded in 1936 by </entity/>Lucía-Sánchez-Saornil Lucía-Sánchez-Saornil, Mercedes Comaposada and </entity/>Amparo-Poch-y-Gascón Amparo-Poch-y-Gascón and had approximately 30,000 members. The organisation was based on the idea of a "double struggle" for </entity/>Feminist-movement </mention/>women's-liberation and </entity/>social-revolution social-revolution and argued that the two objectives were equally important and should be pursued in parallel. In order to gain mutual support, they created networks of women anarchists. </entity/>Lucía-Sánchez-Saornil Lucía-Sánchez-Saornil was a main founder of the Spanish </entity/>anarcha-feminist anarcha-feminist federation </entity/>Mujeres-Libres Mujeres-Libres who was open about her </entity/>lesbian lesbianism. She was published in a variety of literary journals where working under a male pen name, she was able to explore </entity/>lesbian lesbian themes at a time when homosexuality was criminalized and subject to </entity/>censorship censorship and punishment.
More recently, the British </entity/>anarcho-pacifist anarcho-pacifist </entity/>Alex-Comfort Alex-Comfort gained notoriety during the </entity/>sexual-revolution sexual-revolution for writing the bestseller sex manual "</entity/>The-Joy-of-Sex The-Joy-of-Sex". The issue of </entity/>free-love free-love has a dedicated treatment in the work of French anarcho-</entity/>hedonist hedonist philosopher </entity/>Michel-Onfray Michel-Onfray in such works as "Théorie du corps amoureux : pour une érotique solaire" (2000) and "L'invention du plaisir : fragments cyréaniques" (2002).
Libertarian education and freethought.
</entity/> For English anarchist </entity/>William-Godwin William-Godwin education was "the main means by which change would be achieved." Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness. For Godwin education had to have "A respect for the child's autonomy which precluded any form of coercion," "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child's own motivation and initiatives," and "A concern about the child's capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school." In his "</entity/>Political-Justice Political-Justice" he criticises state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government". Early American anarchist </entity/>Josiah-Warren Josiah-Warren advanced alternative education experiences in the libertarian communities he established. </entity/>Max-Stirner Max-Stirner wrote in 1842 a long essay on education called "</entity/>The-False-Principle-of-our-Education The-False-Principle-of-our-Education". In it Stirner names his educational principle "personalist," explaining that self-understanding consists in hourly self-creation. Education for him is to create "free men, sovereign characters," by which he means "eternal characters ... who are therefore eternal because they form themselves each moment".
In the United States "freethought was a basically </entity/>Anti-Christianity </mention/>anti-christian, </entity/>anti-clerical anti-clerical movement, whose purpose was to make the individual politically and spiritually free to decide for himself on religious matters. A number of contributors to "</entity/>Liberty-(1881–1908) </mention/>Liberty" (anarchist publication) were prominent figures in both freethought and anarchism. The individualist anarchist George MacDonald was a co-editor of "Freethought" and, for a time, "The Truth Seeker". E.C. Walker was co-editor of the excellent free-thought / free love journal "</entity/>Lucifer,-the-Light-Bearer Lucifer,-the-Light-Bearer"". "Many of the anarchists were ardent freethinkers; reprints from freethought papers such as "</entity/>Lucifer,-the-Light-Bearer Lucifer,-the-Light-Bearer", "Freethought" and "The Truth Seeker" appeared in "</entity/>Liberty-(1881–1908) </mention/>Liberty"... The church was viewed as a common ally of the state and as a repressive force in and of itself".
In 1901, Catalan anarchist and </entity/>Freethought </mention/>free-thinker </entity/>Francesc-Ferrer-i-Guàrdia Francesc-Ferrer-i-Guàrdia established "modern" or </entity/>Progressive-education </mention/>progressive-schools in </entity/>Barcelona Barcelona in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church. The schools' stated goal was to "</entity/>Popular-education </mention/>educate-the-working-class in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state. </entity/>Murray-Bookchin Murray-Bookchin wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally." La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of "</entity/>Modern-School-(United-States) </mention/>Modern-Schools" in the United States, </entity/>Cuba Cuba, South America and London. The first of these was started in New York City in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper "</entity/>Università-popolare-(Italian-newspaper) </mention/>Università-popolare", founded in 1901. Russian </entity/>christian-anarchist christian-anarchist </entity/>Leo-Tolstoy Leo-Tolstoy established a school for peasant children on his estate. Tolstoy's educational experiments were short-lived due to harassment by the Tsarist secret police. Tolstoy established a conceptual difference between education and culture. He thought that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself ... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary". For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".
A more recent libertarian tradition on education is that of </entity/>unschooling unschooling and the </entity/>anarchist-free-school </mention/>free-school in which child-led activity replaces pedagogic approaches. Experiments in Germany led to </entity/>A.-S.-Neill A.-S.-Neill founding what became </entity/>Summerhill-School Summerhill-School in 1921. Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice. However, although Summerhill and other free schools are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political </entity/>class-struggle class-struggle-approach.
In addition to organising schools according to libertarian principles, anarchists have also questioned the concept of schooling per se. The term </entity/>deschooling deschooling was popularised by </entity/>Ivan-Illich Ivan-Illich, who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.
Criticisms.
Criticisms of anarchism include </entity/>morality </mention/>moral criticisms and pragmatic criticisms. Anarchism is often evaluated as unfeasible or </entity/>utopian utopian by its critics. European history professor Carl Landauer, in his book "European Socialism" argued that social anarchism is unrealistic and that government is a "lesser evil" than a society without "repressive force." He also argued that "ill intentions will cease if repressive force disappears" is an "absurdity."

Autism

Autism is a </entity/>neurodevelopmental-disorder neurodevelopmental-disorder characterized by impaired </entity/>Interpersonal-relationship </mention/>social-interaction, </entity/>language-acquisition </mention/>verbal and </entity/>non-verbal-communication non-verbal-communication, and by restricted and repetitive behavior. The </entity/>Diagnostic-and-Statistical-Manual-of-Mental-Disorders </mention/>diagnostic-criteria require that symptoms become apparent before a child is three years old. Autism affects information processing in the </entity/>Human-brain </mention/>brain by altering how nerve cells and their </entity/>synapse synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. It is one of three recognized disorders in the </entity/>autism-spectrum autism-spectrum (ASDs), the other two being </entity/>Asperger-syndrome Asperger-syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and </entity/>PDD-NOS </mention/>pervasive-developmental-disorder,-not-otherwise-specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which is diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome are not met.
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the </entity/>Heritability-of-autism </mention/>genetics-of-autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare </entity/>mutation mutations, or by rare combinations of common genetic variants. In rare cases, autism is strongly associated with </entity/>Teratology </mention/>agents-that-cause-birth-defects. </entity/>Controversies-in-autism </mention/>Controversies surround other proposed environmental </entity/>Causes-of-autism </mention/>causes, such as </entity/>Heavy-metal-(chemistry) </mention/>heavy-metals, </entity/>pesticide pesticides or childhood </entity/>vaccine vaccines; the vaccine hypotheses are biologically implausible and have been disproven in scientific studies The </entity/>prevalence prevalence of autism is about 1–2 per 1,000 people worldwide, and it occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls. The </entity/>Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention (CDC) report 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The number of people diagnosed with autism has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice and government-subsidized financial incentives for named diagnoses; the question of whether actual prevalence has increased is unresolved.
Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. The signs usually develop gradually, but some autistic children first develop more normally and then </entity/>Regressive-autism </mention/>regress. </entity/>Early-intensive-behavior-intervention </mention/>Early-behavioral, cognitive, or speech interventions can help autistic children gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An </entity/>Sociological-and-cultural-aspects-of-autism </mention/>autistic-culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be </entity/>Autism-rights-movement </mention/>accepted-as-a-difference-and-not-treated-as-a-disorder.
Characteristics.
Autism is a highly variable </entity/>neurodevelopmental-disorder neurodevelopmental-disorder that first appears during infancy or childhood, and generally follows a steady course without </entity/>Remission-(medicine) </mention/>remission. Overt symptoms gradually begin after the age of six months, become established by age two or three years, and tend to continue through adulthood, although often in more muted form. It is distinguished not by a single symptom, but by a characteristic triad of symptoms: impairments in social interaction; impairments in communication; and restricted interests and repetitive behavior. Other aspects, such as atypical eating, are also common but are not essential for diagnosis. Autism's individual symptoms occur in the general population and appear not to associate highly, without a sharp line separating pathologically severe from common traits.
Social development.
Social deficits distinguish autism and the related </entity/>autism-spectrum-disorder autism-spectrum-disorders (ASD; see </entity/>#Classification </mention/>Classification) from other developmental disorders. People with autism have social impairments and often lack the intuition about others that many people take for granted. Noted autistic </entity/>Temple-Grandin Temple-Grandin described her inability to understand the </entity/>social-communication social-communication of </entity/>neurotypical neurotypicals, or people with normal </entity/>neural-development neural-development, as leaving her feeling "like an anthropologist on Mars".
Unusual social development becomes apparent early in childhood. Autistic infants show less attention to social stimuli, smile and look at others less often, and respond less to their own name. Autistic toddlers differ more strikingly from </entity/>social-norms social-norms; for example, they have less </entity/>eye-contact eye-contact and turn taking, and do not have the ability to use simple movements to express themselves, such as the deficiency to point at things. Three- to five-year-old autistic children are less likely to exhibit social understanding, approach others spontaneously, imitate and respond to emotions, communicate nonverbally, and take turns with others. However, they do form </entity/>Attachment-(psychology) </mention/>attachments to their primary caregivers. Most autistic children display moderately less </entity/>Attachment-in-children#Secure-attachment </mention/>attachment-security than non-autistic children, although this difference disappears in children with higher mental development or less severe ASD. Older children and adults with ASD </entity/>Face-perception#Face-perception-in-individuals-with-autism </mention/>perform-worse-on-tests-of-face-and-emotion-recognition.
Children with high-functioning autism suffer from more intense and frequent loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief that children with autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often proves to be difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may affect the quality of life more deeply.
There are many anecdotal reports, but few systematic studies, of aggression and violence in individuals with ASD. The limited data suggest that, in children with intellectual disability, autism is associated with aggression, destruction of property, and </entity/>tantrum tantrums. A 2007 study interviewed parents of 67 children with ASD and reported that about two-thirds of the children had periods of severe tantrums and about one-third had a history of aggression, with tantrums significantly more common than in non-autistic children with language impairments. A 2008 Swedish study found that, of individuals aged 15 or older discharged from hospital with a diagnosis of ASD, those who committed violent crimes were significantly more likely to have other psychopathological conditions such as </entity/>psychosis psychosis.
Communication.
About a third to a half of individuals with autism do not develop enough natural speech to meet their daily communication needs. Differences in communication may be present from the first year of life, and may include delayed onset of </entity/>babbling babbling, unusual gestures, diminished responsiveness, and vocal patterns that are not synchronized with the caregiver. In the second and third years, autistic children have less frequent and less diverse babbling, consonants, words, and word combinations; their gestures are less often integrated with words. Autistic children are less likely to make requests or share experiences, and are more likely to simply repeat others' words (</entity/>echolalia echolalia) or </entity/>Pronoun-reversal </mention/>reverse-pronouns. </entity/>Joint-attention Joint-attention seems to be necessary for functional speech, and deficits in joint attention seem to distinguish infants with ASD: for example, they may look at a pointing hand instead of the pointed-at object, and they consistently fail to point at objects in order to comment on or share an experience. Autistic children may have difficulty with imaginative play and with developing symbols into language.
In a pair of studies, high-functioning autistic children aged 8–15 performed equally well as, and adults better than, individually matched controls at basic language tasks involving vocabulary and spelling. Both autistic groups performed worse than controls at complex language tasks such as figurative language, comprehension and inference. As people are often sized up initially from their basic language skills, these studies suggest that people speaking to autistic individuals are more likely to overestimate what their audience comprehends.
Repetitive behavior.
Autistic individuals display many forms of repetitive or restricted behavior, which the Repetitive Behavior Scale-Revised (RBS-R) categorizes as follows.
</entity/>
No single repetitive or self-injurious behavior seems to be specific to autism, but only autism appears to have an elevated pattern of occurrence and severity of these behaviors.
Other symptoms.
Autistic individuals may have symptoms that are independent of the diagnosis, but that can affect the individual or the family.
An estimated 0.5% to 10% of individuals with ASD show unusual abilities, ranging from splinter skills such as the memorization of trivia to the extraordinarily rare talents of prodigious </entity/>Savant-syndrome </mention/>autistic-savants. Many individuals with ASD show superior skills in perception and attention, relative to the general population.
</entity/>Sensory-system </mention/>Sensory abnormalities are found in over 90% of those with autism, and are considered core features by some, although there is no good evidence that sensory symptoms differentiate autism from other developmental disorders. Differences are greater for under-responsivity (for example, walking into things) than for over-responsivity (for example, distress from loud noises) or for sensation seeking (for example, rhythmic movements).
An estimated 60%–80% of autistic people have motor signs that include </entity/>poor-muscle-tone poor-muscle-tone, </entity/>Apraxia </mention/>poor-motor-planning, and </entity/>toe-walking toe-walking; deficits in motor coordination are pervasive across ASD and are greater in autism proper.
Unusual eating behavior occurs in about three-quarters of children with ASD, to the extent that it was formerly a diagnostic indicator. Selectivity is the most common problem, although eating rituals and food refusal also occur; this does not appear to result in </entity/>malnutrition malnutrition. Although some children with autism also have </entity/>gastrointestinal gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms, there is a lack of published rigorous data to support the theory that autistic children have more or different GI symptoms than usual; studies report conflicting results, and the relationship between GI problems and ASD is unclear.
Parents of children with ASD have higher levels of </entity/>stress-(psychological) </mention/>stress. Siblings of children with ASD report greater admiration of and less conflict with the affected sibling than siblings of unaffected children and were similar to siblings of children with </entity/>Down-syndrome Down-syndrome in these aspects of the sibling relationship. However, they reported lower levels of closeness and intimacy than siblings of children with </entity/>Down-syndrome Down-syndrome; siblings of individuals with ASD have greater risk of negative well-being and poorer sibling relationships as adults.
Causes.
It has long been presumed that there is a common cause at the genetic, cognitive, and neural levels for autism's characteristic triad of symptoms. However, there is increasing suspicion that autism is instead a complex disorder whose core aspects have distinct causes that often co-occur.
</entity/>
Autism has a strong genetic basis, although the </entity/>Heritability-of-autism </mention/>genetics-of-autism are complex and it is unclear whether ASD is explained more by rare </entity/>mutation mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene interactions of common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and </entity/>epigenetic epigenetic factors which do not change </entity/>DNA DNA but are heritable and influence </entity/>gene-expression gene-expression. Studies of twins suggest that </entity/>heritability heritability is 0.7 for autism and as high as 0.9 for ASD, and siblings of those with autism are about 25 times more likely to be autistic than the general population. However, most of the mutations that increase autism risk have not been identified. Typically, autism cannot be traced to a </entity/>Mendelian Mendelian (single-gene) mutation or to a single </entity/>chromosome-abnormality chromosome-abnormality, and none of the genetic syndromes associated with ASDs have been shown to selectively cause ASD. Numerous candidate genes have been located, with only small effects attributable to any particular gene. The large number of autistic individuals with unaffected family members may result from </entity/>copy-number-variation copy-number-variations—spontaneous </entity/>Deletion-(genetics) </mention/>deletions or </entity/>Gene-duplication </mention/>duplications in genetic material during </entity/>meiosis meiosis. Hence, a substantial fraction of autism cases may be traceable to genetic causes that are highly heritable but not inherited: that is, the mutation that causes the autism is not present in the parental genome.
Several lines of evidence point to </entity/>Synapse </mention/>synaptic dysfunction as a cause of autism. Some rare mutations may lead to autism by disrupting some synaptic pathways, such as those involved with </entity/>cell-adhesion cell-adhesion. Gene replacement studies in mice suggest that autistic symptoms are closely related to later developmental steps that depend on activity in synapses and on activity-dependent changes. All known </entity/>teratogen teratogens (agents that cause </entity/>birth-defect birth-defects) related to the risk of autism appear to act during the first eight weeks from </entity/>Human-fertilization </mention/>conception, and though this does not exclude the possibility that autism can be initiated or affected later, there is strong evidence that autism arises very early in development.
Although evidence for other environmental causes is anecdotal and has not been confirmed by reliable studies, extensive searches are underway. </entity/>Environmental-factor Environmental-factors that have been claimed to contribute to or exacerbate autism, or may be important in future research, include certain foods, </entity/>infectious-disease infectious-diseases, </entity/>heavy-metals heavy-metals, </entity/>solvent solvents, </entity/>diesel-exhaust diesel-exhaust, </entity/>PCBs PCBs, </entity/>phthalates phthalates and </entity/>phenols phenols used in plastic products, </entity/>pesticide pesticides, </entity/>brominated-flame-retardant brominated-flame-retardants, </entity/>Ethanol </mention/>alcohol, smoking, </entity/>illicit-drug illicit-drugs, </entity/>vaccine vaccines, and </entity/>prenatal-stress prenatal-stress, although no links have been found, and some have been completely disproven.
Parents may first become aware of autistic symptoms in their child around the time of a routine vaccination. This has led to unsupported theories blaming </entity/>Vaccine-controversy#Vaccine-overload </mention/>vaccine-"overload", a </entity/>Thiomersal-controversy </mention/>vaccine-preservative, or the </entity/>MMR-vaccine-controversy </mention/>MMR-vaccine for causing autism. The latter theory was supported by a litigation-funded study that has since been shown to have been "an elaborate fraud". Although these theories lack convincing scientific evidence and are biologically implausible, parental concern about a potential vaccine link with autism has led to lower rates of </entity/>childhood-immunizations childhood-immunizations, </entity/>MMR-vaccine-controversy#Disease-outbreaks </mention/>outbreaks-of-previously-controlled-childhood-diseases in some countries, and the preventable deaths of several children.
Mechanism.
Autism's symptoms result from maturation-related changes in various systems of the brain. How autism occurs is not well understood. Its mechanism can be divided into two areas: the </entity/>pathophysiology pathophysiology of brain structures and processes associated with autism, and the </entity/>neuropsychological neuropsychological linkages between brain structures and behaviors. The behaviors appear to have multiple pathophysiologies.
Pathophysiology.
</entity/>
Unlike many other brain disorders, such as </entity/>Parkinson's Parkinson's, autism does not have a clear unifying mechanism at either the molecular, cellular, or systems level; it is not known whether autism is a few disorders caused by mutations converging on a few common molecular pathways, or is (like intellectual disability) a large set of disorders with diverse mechanisms. Autism appears to result from developmental factors that affect many or all functional brain systems, and to disturb the timing of brain development more than the final product. </entity/>Neuroanatomical Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with </entity/>teratogens teratogens strongly suggest that autism's mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. This anomaly appears to start a cascade of pathological events in the brain that are significantly influenced by environmental factors. Just after birth, the brains of autistic children tend to grow faster than usual, followed by normal or relatively slower growth in childhood. It is not known whether early overgrowth occurs in all autistic children. It seems to be most prominent in brain areas underlying the development of higher cognitive specialization. Hypotheses for the cellular and molecular bases of pathological early overgrowth include the following:
The </entity/>immune-system immune-system is thought to play an important role in autism, autistic children have been found by researchers to have </entity/>inflammation inflammation of both the peripheral and central immune systems as indicated by increased levels of pro-inflammatory </entity/>cytokines cytokines and significant activation of </entity/>microglia microglia. Biomarkers of abnormal immune function have also been associated with increased impairments in behaviors that are characteristic of the core features of autism such as deficits in social interactions and communication. Interactions between the </entity/>immune-system immune-system and the </entity/>nervous-system nervous-system begin early during the </entity/>Human-embryogenesis </mention/>embryonic-stage of life, and successful neurodevelopment depends on a balanced immune response. It is thought that activation of a pregnant mothers immune system such as from environmental toxicants or infection can contribute to causing autism through causing a disruption of brain development. This is supported by recent studies that have found that infection during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of autism 
The relationship of </entity/>neurochemical neurochemicals to autism is not well understood; several have been investigated, with the most evidence for the role of </entity/>serotonin serotonin and of genetic differences in its transport. The role of group I </entity/>metabotropic-glutamate-receptors metabotropic-glutamate-receptors (mGluR) in the pathogenesis of </entity/>fragile-X-syndrome fragile-X-syndrome, the most common identified genetic cause of autism, has led to interest in the possible implications for future autism research into this pathway. Some data suggests neuronal overgrowth potentially related to an increase in several </entity/>growth-hormone growth-hormones or to impaired regulation of </entity/>growth-factor-receptor growth-factor-receptors. Also, some </entity/>inborn-errors-of-metabolism inborn-errors-of-metabolism are associated with autism, but probably account for less than 5% of cases.
The </entity/>mirror-neuron-system mirror-neuron-system (MNS) theory of autism hypothesizes that distortion in the development of the MNS interferes with imitation and leads to autism's core features of social impairment and communication difficulties. The MNS operates when an animal performs an action or observes another animal perform the same action. The MNS may contribute to an individual's understanding of other people by enabling the modeling of their behavior via embodied simulation of their actions, intentions, and emotions. Several studies have tested this hypothesis by demonstrating structural abnormalities in MNS regions of individuals with ASD, delay in the activation in the core circuit for imitation in individuals with Asperger syndrome, and a correlation between reduced MNS activity and severity of the syndrome in children with ASD. However, individuals with autism also have abnormal brain activation in many circuits outside the MNS and the MNS theory does not explain the normal performance of autistic children on imitation tasks that involve a goal or object.
</entity/>
ASD-related patterns of low function and aberrant activation in the brain differ depending on whether the brain is doing social or nonsocial tasks.
In autism there is evidence for reduced functional connectivity of the </entity/>default-network default-network, a large-scale brain network involved in social and emotional processing, with intact connectivity of the </entity/>task-positive-network task-positive-network, used in sustained attention and goal-directed thinking. In people with autism the two networks are not negatively correlated in time, suggesting an imbalance in toggling between the two networks, possibly reflecting a disturbance of </entity/>self-referential self-referential thought. A 2008 brain-imaging study found a specific pattern of signals in the </entity/>cingulate-cortex cingulate-cortex which differs in individuals with ASD.
The underconnectivity theory of autism hypothesizes that autism is marked by underfunctioning high-level neural connections and synchronization, along with an excess of low-level processes. Evidence for this theory has been found in </entity/>functional-neuroimaging functional-neuroimaging studies on autistic individuals and by a </entity/>Electroencephalography </mention/>brainwave study that suggested that adults with ASD have local overconnectivity in the </entity/>Cerebral-cortex </mention/>cortex and weak functional connections between the </entity/>frontal-lobe frontal-lobe and the rest of the cortex. Other evidence suggests the underconnectivity is mainly within each </entity/>Cerebral-hemisphere </mention/>hemisphere of the cortex and that autism is a disorder of the </entity/>Association-areas </mention/>association-cortex.
From studies based on </entity/>event-related-potential event-related-potentials, transient changes to the brain's electrical activity in response to stimuli, there is considerable evidence for differences in autistic individuals with respect to attention, orientation to auditory and visual stimuli, novelty detection, language and face processing, and information storage; several studies have found a preference for nonsocial stimuli. For example, </entity/>magnetoencephalography magnetoencephalography studies have found evidence in autistic children of delayed responses in the brain's processing of auditory signals.
In the genetic area, relations have been found between autism and </entity/>schizophrenia schizophrenia based on duplications and deletions of chromosomes; research showed that schizophrenia and autism are significantly more common in combination with </entity/>1q21.1-deletion-syndrome 1q21.1-deletion-syndrome. Research on autism/schizophrenia relations for chromosome 15 (15q13.3), chromosome 16 (16p13.1) and chromosome 17 (17p12) are inconclusive.
Neuropsychology.
Two major categories of </entity/>cognitive cognitive theories have been proposed about the links between autistic brains and behavior.
The first category focuses on deficits in </entity/>social-cognition social-cognition. </entity/>Simon-Baron-Cohen Simon-Baron-Cohen's </entity/>empathizing–systemizing-theory empathizing–systemizing-theory postulates that autistic individuals can systemize—that is, they can develop internal rules of operation to handle events inside the brain—but are less effective at empathizing by handling events generated by other agents. An extension, the extreme male brain theory, hypothesizes that autism is an extreme case of the male brain, defined psychometrically as individuals in whom systemizing is better than empathizing. These theories are somewhat related to Baron-Cohen's earlier </entity/>theory-of-mind theory-of-mind approach, which hypothesizes that autistic behavior arises from an inability to ascribe mental states to oneself and others. The theory of mind hypothesis is supported by autistic children's atypical responses to the </entity/>Sally–Anne-test Sally–Anne-test for reasoning about others' motivations, and the mirror neuron system theory of autism described in "</entity/>#Pathophysiology </mention/>Pathophysiology" maps well to the hypothesis. However, most studies have found no evidence of impairment in autistic individuals' ability to understand other people's basic intentions or goals; instead, data suggests that impairments are found in understanding more complex social emotions or in considering others' viewpoints.
The second category focuses on nonsocial or general processing: the </entity/>executive-functions executive-functions such as </entity/>working-memory working-memory, planning, </entity/>Inhibition-Theory </mention/>inhibition. In his review, Kenworthy states that "the claim of </entity/>executive-dysfunction executive-dysfunction as a causal factor in autism is controversial", however, "it is clear that executive dysfunction plays a role in the social and cognitive deficits observed in individuals with autism". Tests of core executive processes such as eye movement tasks indicate improvement from late childhood to adolescence, but performance never reaches typical adult levels. A strength of the theory is predicting stereotyped behavior and narrow interests; two weaknesses are that executive function is hard to measure and that executive function deficits have not been found in young autistic children.
</entity/>Weak-central-coherence-theory Weak-central-coherence-theory hypothesizes that a limited ability to see the big picture underlies the central disturbance in autism. One strength of this theory is predicting special talents and peaks in performance in autistic people. A related theory—enhanced perceptual functioning—focuses more on the superiority of locally oriented and </entity/>perceptual perceptual operations in autistic individuals. These theories map well from the underconnectivity theory of autism.
Neither category is satisfactory on its own; social cognition theories poorly address autism's rigid and repetitive behaviors, while the nonsocial theories have difficulty explaining social impairment and communication difficulties. A combined theory based on multiple deficits may prove to be more useful.
Diagnosis.
</entity/>Medical-diagnosis </mention/>Diagnosis is based on behavior, not cause or mechanism. Autism is defined in the </entity/>DSM-IV-TR DSM-IV-TR as exhibiting at least six symptoms total, including at least two symptoms of qualitative impairment in social interaction, at least one symptom of qualitative impairment in communication, and at least one symptom of restricted and repetitive behavior. Sample symptoms include lack of social or emotional reciprocity, stereotyped and repetitive use of language or </entity/>Idiosyncrasy#Psychiatry-and-psychology </mention/>idiosyncratic-language, and persistent preoccupation with parts of objects. Onset must be prior to age three years, with delays or abnormal functioning in either social interaction, language as used in social communication, or symbolic or imaginative play. The disturbance must not be better accounted for by </entity/>Rett-syndrome Rett-syndrome or </entity/>childhood-disintegrative-disorder childhood-disintegrative-disorder. </entity/>ICD-10 ICD-10 uses essentially the same definition.
Several diagnostic instruments are available. Two are commonly used in autism research: the </entity/>Autism-Diagnostic-Interview-Revised Autism-Diagnostic-Interview-Revised (ADI-R) is a semistructured parent interview, and the </entity/>Autism-Diagnostic-Observation-Schedule Autism-Diagnostic-Observation-Schedule (ADOS) uses observation and interaction with the child. The </entity/>Childhood-Autism-Rating-Scale Childhood-Autism-Rating-Scale (CARS) is used widely in clinical environments to assess severity of autism based on observation of children.
A </entity/>pediatrician pediatrician commonly performs a preliminary investigation by taking developmental history and physically examining the child. If warranted, diagnosis and evaluations are conducted with help from ASD specialists, observing and assessing cognitive, communication, family, and other factors using standardized tools, and taking into account any associated </entity/>medical-conditions medical-conditions. A pediatric </entity/>neuropsychologist neuropsychologist is often asked to assess behavior and cognitive skills, both to aid diagnosis and to help recommend educational interventions. A </entity/>differential-diagnosis differential-diagnosis for ASD at this stage might also consider </entity/>intellectual-disability intellectual-disability, </entity/>hearing-impairment hearing-impairment, and a </entity/>specific-language-impairment specific-language-impairment such as </entity/>Landau–Kleffner-syndrome Landau–Kleffner-syndrome. The presence of autism can make it harder to diagnose coexisting psychiatric disorders such as </entity/>Major-depressive-disorder </mention/>depression.
</entity/>Clinical-genetics Clinical-genetics evaluations are often done once ASD is diagnosed, particularly when other symptoms already suggest a genetic cause. Although genetic technology allows clinical geneticists to link an estimated 40% of cases to genetic causes, consensus guidelines in the US and UK are limited to high-resolution chromosome and </entity/>fragile-X fragile-X testing. A </entity/>genotype genotype-first model of diagnosis has been proposed, which would routinely assess the genome's copy number variations. As new genetic tests are developed several ethical, legal, and social issues will emerge. Commercial availability of tests may precede adequate understanding of how to use test results, given the complexity of autism's genetics. </entity/>Metabolic Metabolic and </entity/>neuroimaging neuroimaging tests are sometimes helpful, but are not routine.
ASD can sometimes be diagnosed by age 14 months, although diagnosis becomes increasingly stable over the first three years of life: for example, a one-year-old who meets diagnostic criteria for ASD is less likely than a three-year-old to continue to do so a few years later. In the UK the National Autism Plan for Children recommends at most 30 weeks from first concern to completed diagnosis and assessment, though few cases are handled that quickly in practice. A 2009 US study found the average age of formal ASD diagnosis was 5.7 years, far above recommendations, and that 27% of children remained undiagnosed at age 8 years. Although the symptoms of autism and ASD begin early in childhood, they are sometimes missed; years later, adults may seek diagnoses to help them or their friends and family understand themselves, to help their employers make adjustments, or in some locations to claim disability living allowances or other benefits.
Underdiagnosis and overdiagnosis are problems in marginal cases, and much of the recent increase in the number of reported ASD cases is likely due to changes in diagnostic practices. The increasing popularity of drug treatment options and the expansion of benefits has given providers incentives to diagnose ASD, resulting in some overdiagnosis of children with uncertain symptoms. Conversely, the cost of screening and diagnosis and the challenge of obtaining payment can inhibit or delay diagnosis. It is particularly hard to diagnose autism among the </entity/>visually-impaired visually-impaired, partly because some of its diagnostic criteria depend on vision, and partly because autistic symptoms overlap with those of common blindness syndromes or </entity/>blindism blindisms.
Classification.
Autism is one of the five </entity/>pervasive-developmental-disorder pervasive-developmental-disorders (PDD), which are characterized by widespread abnormalities of social interactions and communication, and severely restricted interests and highly repetitive behavior. These symptoms do not imply sickness, fragility, or emotional disturbance.
Of the five PDD forms, </entity/>Asperger-syndrome Asperger-syndrome is closest to autism in signs and likely causes; </entity/>Rett-syndrome Rett-syndrome and </entity/>childhood-disintegrative-disorder childhood-disintegrative-disorder share several signs with autism, but may have unrelated causes; </entity/>PDD-not-otherwise-specified PDD-not-otherwise-specified (PDD-NOS; also called "atypical autism") is diagnosed when the criteria are not met for a more specific disorder. Unlike with autism, people with Asperger syndrome have no substantial delay in </entity/>language-development language-development. The terminology of autism can be bewildering, with autism, Asperger syndrome and PDD-NOS often called the "autism spectrum disorders" (ASD) or sometimes the "autistic disorders", whereas autism itself is often called "autistic disorder","childhood autism", or "infantile autism". In this article, "autism" refers to the classic autistic disorder; in clinical practice, though, "autism", "ASD", and "PDD" are often used interchangeably. ASD, in turn, is a subset of the broader autism </entity/>phenotype phenotype, which describes individuals who may not have ASD but do have autistic-like </entity/>Trait-(biology) </mention/>traits, such as avoiding eye contact.
The manifestations of autism cover a wide </entity/>Spectrum-disorder </mention/>spectrum, ranging from individuals with severe impairments—who may be silent, </entity/>developmentally-disabled developmentally-disabled, and locked into hand flapping and rocking—to high functioning individuals who may have active but distinctly odd social approaches, narrowly focused interests, and verbose, </entity/>pedantic pedantic communication. Because the behavior spectrum is continuous, boundaries between diagnostic categories are necessarily somewhat arbitrary. Sometimes the syndrome is divided into low-, medium- or </entity/>high-functioning-autism high-functioning-autism (LFA, MFA, and HFA), based on </entity/>IQ IQ thresholds, or on how much support the individual requires in daily life; these subdivisions are not standardized and are controversial. Autism can also be divided into </entity/>Syndrome </mention/>syndromal and non-syndromal autism; the syndromal autism is associated with severe or profound </entity/>intellectual-disability intellectual-disability or a congenital syndrome with physical symptoms, such as </entity/>tuberous-sclerosis tuberous-sclerosis. Although individuals with Asperger syndrome tend to perform better cognitively than those with autism, the extent of the </entity/>Diagnosis-of-Asperger-syndrome#Differences-from-high-functioning-autism </mention/>overlap-between-Asperger-syndrome,-HFA,-and-non-syndromal-autism is unclear.
Some studies have reported diagnoses of autism in children due to a loss of language or social skills, as opposed to a failure to make progress, typically from 15 to 30 months of age. The validity of this distinction remains controversial; it is possible that </entity/>regressive-autism regressive-autism is a specific subtype, or that there is a continuum of behaviors between autism with and without regression.
Research into causes has been hampered by the inability to identify biologically meaningful subgroups within the autistic population and by the traditional boundaries between the disciplines of </entity/>psychiatry psychiatry, </entity/>psychology psychology, </entity/>neurology neurology and </entity/>pediatrics pediatrics. Newer technologies such as </entity/>fMRI fMRI and </entity/>diffusion-tensor-imaging diffusion-tensor-imaging can help identify biologically relevant </entity/>phenotype phenotypes (observable traits) that can be viewed on </entity/>brain-scan brain-scans, to help further </entity/>neurogenetic neurogenetic studies of autism; one example is lowered activity in the </entity/>fusiform-face-area fusiform-face-area of the brain, which is associated with impaired perception of people versus objects. It has been proposed to classify autism using genetics as well as behavior.
Screening.
About half of parents of children with ASD notice their child's unusual behaviors by age 18 months, and about four-fifths notice by age 24 months. According to an article in the "Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders", failure to meet any of the following milestones "is an absolute indication to proceed with further evaluations. Delay in referral for such testing may delay early diagnosis and treatment and affect the long-term outcome".
US and Japanese practice is to </entity/>Screening-(medicine) </mention/>screen all children for ASD at 18 and 24 months, using autism-specific formal screening tests. In contrast, in the UK, children whose families or doctors recognize possible signs of autism are screened. It is not known which approach is more effective. Screening tools include the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT), the Early Screening of Autistic Traits Questionnaire, and the First Year Inventory; initial data on M-CHAT and its predecessor CHAT on children aged 18–30 months suggests that it is best used in a clinical setting and that it has low </entity/>Sensitivity-(tests) </mention/>sensitivity (many false-negatives) but good </entity/>Specificity-(tests) </mention/>specificity (few false-positives). It may be more accurate to precede these tests with a broadband screener that does not distinguish ASD from other developmental disorders. Screening tools designed for one culture's norms for behaviors like eye contact may be inappropriate for a different culture. Although </entity/>genetic-screening genetic-screening for autism is generally still impractical, it can be considered in some cases, such as children with neurological symptoms and </entity/>dysmorphic-feature dysmorphic-features.
Management.
</entity/>
The main goals when treating children with autism are to lessen associated deficits and family distress, and to increase quality of life and functional independence. No single treatment is best and treatment is typically tailored to the child's needs. Families and the educational system are the main resources for treatment. Studies of interventions have methodological problems that prevent definitive conclusions about </entity/>efficacy efficacy. Although many </entity/>psychosocial psychosocial interventions have some positive evidence, suggesting that some form of treatment is preferable to no treatment, the methodological quality of </entity/>systematic-review systematic-reviews of these studies has generally been poor, their clinical results are mostly tentative, and there is little evidence for the relative effectiveness of treatment options. Intensive, sustained </entity/>special-education special-education programs and </entity/>behavior-therapy behavior-therapy early in life can help children acquire self-care, social, and job skills, and often improve functioning and decrease symptom severity and maladaptive behaviors; claims that intervention by around age three years is crucial are not substantiated. Available approaches include </entity/>applied-behavior-analysis applied-behavior-analysis (ABA), developmental models, </entity/>TEACCH </mention/>structured-teaching, </entity/>speech-and-language-therapy speech-and-language-therapy, </entity/>social-skills social-skills therapy, and </entity/>occupational-therapy occupational-therapy. There is some evidence that early intensive behavioral intervention, an early intervention model for 20 to 40 hours a week for multiple years, is an effective behavioral treatment for some children with ASD.
Educational interventions can be effective to varying degrees in most children: </entity/>Early-intensive-behavioral-intervention </mention/>intensive-ABA-treatment has demonstrated effectiveness in enhancing global functioning in preschool children and is well-established for improving intellectual performance of young children. Neuropsychological reports are often poorly communicated to educators, resulting in a gap between what a report recommends and what education is provided. It is not known whether treatment programs for children lead to significant improvements after the children grow up, and the limited research on the effectiveness of adult residential programs shows mixed results. The appropriateness of including children with varying severity of autism spectrum disorders in the general education population is a subject of current debate among educators and researchers.
Many medications are used to treat ASD symptoms that interfere with integrating a child into home or school when behavioral treatment fails. More than half of US children diagnosed with ASD are prescribed </entity/>psychoactive-drug psychoactive-drugs or </entity/>anticonvulsant anticonvulsants, with the most common drug classes being </entity/>antidepressant antidepressants, </entity/>stimulant stimulants, and </entity/>antipsychotic antipsychotics. Aside from antipsychotics, Both aripiprazole and risperidone are effective for treating irritability in children with autistic disorders. there is scant reliable research about the effectiveness or safety of drug treatments for adolescents and adults with ASD. A person with ASD may respond atypically to medications, the medications can have </entity/>Adverse-effect-(medicine) </mention/>adverse-effects, and no known medication relieves autism's core symptoms of social and communication impairments. Experiments in mice have reversed or reduced some symptoms related to autism by replacing or modulating gene function, suggesting the possibility of targeting therapies to specific rare mutations known to cause autism.
Although many </entity/>Alternative-therapies-for-developmental-and-learning-disabilities </mention/>alternative-therapies-and-interventions are available, few are supported by scientific studies. Treatment approaches have little empirical support in </entity/>Quality-of-life </mention/>quality-of-life contexts, and many programs focus on success measures that lack predictive validity and real-world relevance. Scientific evidence appears to matter less to service providers than program marketing, training availability, and parent requests. Some alternative treatments may place the child at risk. A 2008 study found that compared to their peers, autistic boys have significantly thinner bones if on </entity/>casein-free-diet casein-free-diets; in 2005, botched </entity/>chelation-therapy chelation-therapy killed a five-year-old child with autism. There has been early research looking at </entity/>Hyperbaric-medicine </mention/>hyperbaric-treatments in autistic children.
Treatment is expensive; indirect costs are more so. For someone born in 2000, a US study estimated an average lifetime cost of $ (</entity/>net-present-value net-present-value in 2015 dollars, inflation-adjusted from 2003 estimate), with about 10% </entity/>medical-care medical-care, 30% extra education and other care, and 60% lost economic productivity. Publicly supported programs are often inadequate or inappropriate for a given child, and unreimbursed out-of-pocket medical or therapy expenses are associated with likelihood of family financial problems; one 2008 US study found a 14% average loss of annual income in families of children with ASD, and a related study found that ASD is associated with higher probability that </entity/>child-care child-care problems will greatly affect parental employment. US states increasingly require private health insurance to cover autism services, shifting costs from publicly funded education programs to privately funded health insurance. After childhood, key treatment issues include residential care, job training and placement, sexuality, social skills, and </entity/>estate-planning estate-planning.
Prognosis.
There is no known cure. Children recover occasionally, so that they lose their diagnosis of ASD; this occurs sometimes after intensive treatment and sometimes not. It is not known how often recovery happens; reported rates in unselected samples of children with ASD have ranged from 3% to 25%. Most autistic children can acquire language by age 5 or younger, though a few have developed communication skills in later years. Most children with autism lack </entity/>social-support social-support, meaningful relationships, future employment opportunities or </entity/>Self-determination-theory </mention/>self-determination. Although core difficulties tend to persist, symptoms often become less severe with age.
Few high-quality studies address long-term </entity/>prognosis prognosis. Some adults show modest improvement in communication skills, but a few decline; no study has focused on autism after midlife. Acquiring language before age six, having an </entity/>IQ IQ above 50, and having a marketable skill all predict better outcomes; </entity/>independent-living independent-living is unlikely with severe autism. A 2004 British study of 68 adults who were diagnosed before 1980 as autistic children with IQ above 50 found that 12% achieved a high level of independence as adults, 10% had some friends and were generally in work but required some support, 19% had some independence but were generally living at home and needed considerable support and supervision in daily living, 46% needed specialist residential provision from facilities specializing in ASD with a high level of support and very limited autonomy, and 12% needed high-level hospital care. A 2005 Swedish study of 78 adults that did not exclude low IQ found worse prognosis; for example, only 4% achieved independence. A 2008 Canadian study of 48 young adults diagnosed with ASD as preschoolers found outcomes ranging through poor (46%), fair (32%), good (17%), and very good (4%); 56% of these young adults had been employed at some point during their lives, mostly in volunteer, sheltered or </entity/>part-time part-time work. Changes in diagnostic practice and increased availability of effective early intervention make it unclear whether these findings can be generalized to recently diagnosed children.
Epidemiology.
</entity/>
Most recent </entity/>review reviews tend to estimate a prevalence of 1–2 per 1,000 for autism and close to 6 per 1,000 for ASD, and 11 per 1,000 children in the United States for ASD as of 2008; because of inadequate data, these numbers may underestimate ASD's true prevalence. </entity/>PDD-NOS PDD-NOS's prevalence has been estimated at 3.7 per 1,000, Asperger syndrome at roughly 0.6 per 1,000, and </entity/>childhood-disintegrative-disorder childhood-disintegrative-disorder at 0.02 per 1,000. The number of reported cases of autism increased dramatically in the 1990s and early 2000s. This increase is largely attributable to changes in diagnostic practices, referral patterns, availability of services, age at diagnosis, and public awareness, though unidentified environmental risk factors cannot be ruled out. The available evidence does not rule out the possibility that autism's true prevalence has increased; a real increase would suggest directing more attention and funding toward changing environmental factors instead of continuing to focus on genetics.
Boys are at higher risk for ASD than girls. The sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with intellectual disability and more than 5.5:1 without. Several theories about the higher prevalence in males have been investigated, but the cause of the difference is unconfirmed. Although the evidence does not implicate any single pregnancy-related risk factor as a cause of autism, the risk of autism is associated with advanced age in either parent, and with diabetes, bleeding, and use of psychiatric drugs in the mother during pregnancy. The risk is greater with older fathers than with older mothers; two potential explanations are the known increase in mutation burden in older sperm, and the hypothesis that men marry later if they carry genetic liability and show some signs of autism. Most professionals believe that race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic background do not affect the occurrence of autism.
Several other conditions are common in children with autism. They include:
History.
</entity/>
A few examples of autistic symptoms and treatments were described long before autism was named. The "</entity/>Table-Talk-(Luther) </mention/>Table-Talk" of </entity/>Martin-Luther Martin-Luther, compiled by his notetaker, Mathesius, contains the story of a 12-year-old boy who may have been severely autistic. Luther reportedly thought the boy was a soulless mass of flesh possessed by the devil, and suggested that he be suffocated, although a later critic has cast doubt on the veracity of this report. The earliest well-documented case of autism is that of Hugh Blair of Borgue, as detailed in a 1747 court case in which his brother successfully petitioned to annul Blair's marriage to gain Blair's inheritance. The </entity/>Wild-Boy-of-Aveyron Wild-Boy-of-Aveyron, a </entity/>feral-child feral-child caught in 1798, showed several signs of autism; the medical student </entity/>Jean-Marc-Gaspard-Itard </mention/>Jean-Itard treated him with a behavioral program designed to help him form social attachments and to induce speech via imitation.
The </entity/>New-Latin New-Latin word "autismus" (English translation "autism") was coined by the </entity/>Swiss Swiss psychiatrist </entity/>Eugen-Bleuler Eugen-Bleuler in 1910 as he was defining symptoms of </entity/>schizophrenia schizophrenia. He derived it from the Greek word "autós" (αὐτός, meaning "self"), and used it to mean morbid self-admiration, referring to "autistic withdrawal of the patient to his fantasies, against which any influence from outside becomes an intolerable disturbance".
The word "autism" first took its modern sense in 1938 when </entity/>Hans-Asperger Hans-Asperger of the </entity/>Vienna-General-Hospital </mention/>Vienna-University-Hospital adopted Bleuler's terminology "autistic psychopaths" in a lecture in German about </entity/>child-psychology child-psychology. Asperger was investigating an ASD now known as </entity/>Asperger-syndrome Asperger-syndrome, though for various reasons it was not widely recognized as a separate diagnosis until 1981. </entity/>Leo-Kanner Leo-Kanner of the </entity/>Johns-Hopkins-Hospital Johns-Hopkins-Hospital first used "autism" in its modern sense in English when he introduced the label "early infantile autism" in a 1943 report of 11 children with striking behavioral similarities. Almost all the characteristics described in Kanner's first paper on the subject, notably "autistic aloneness" and "insistence on sameness", are still regarded as typical of the autistic spectrum of disorders. It is not known whether Kanner derived the term independently of Asperger.
Kanner's reuse of "autism" led to decades of confused terminology like "infantile schizophrenia", and child psychiatry's focus on maternal deprivation led to misconceptions of autism as an infant's response to "</entity/>refrigerator-mother refrigerator-mothers". Starting in the late 1960s autism was established as a separate syndrome by demonstrating that it is lifelong, distinguishing it from intellectual disability and schizophrenia and from other developmental disorders, and demonstrating the benefits of involving parents in active programs of therapy. As late as the mid-1970s there was little evidence of a genetic role in autism; now it is thought to be one of the most heritable of all psychiatric conditions. Although the rise of parent organizations and the destigmatization of childhood ASD have deeply affected how we view ASD, parents continue to feel </entity/>social-stigma social-stigma in situations where their autistic children's behaviors are perceived negatively by others, and many </entity/>primary-care-physician primary-care-physicians and </entity/>medical-specialist medical-specialists still express some beliefs consistent with outdated autism research.
The Internet has helped autistic individuals bypass nonverbal cues and emotional sharing that they find so hard to deal with, and has given them a way to form online communities and work remotely. </entity/>Sociological-and-cultural-aspects-of-autism Sociological-and-cultural-aspects-of-autism have developed: some in the community seek a cure, while others believe that </entity/>Neurodiversity </mention/>autism-is-simply-another-way-of-being.

Albedo

</entity/>
Albedo (), or "reflection coefficient", derived from </entity/>Latin Latin "albedo" "whiteness" (or reflected sunlight) in turn from "albus" "white," is the </entity/>diffuse-reflection </mention/>diffuse-reflectivity or reflecting power of a surface. It is the ratio of reflected radiation from the surface to incident radiation upon it. Its </entity/>Dimensionless-number </mention/>dimensionless nature lets it be expressed as a percentage and is measured on a scale from zero for no reflection of a perfectly black surface to 1 for perfect reflection of a white surface.
Albedo depends on the </entity/>frequency frequency of the radiation. When quoted unqualified, it usually refers to some appropriate average across the spectrum of </entity/>visible-light visible-light. In general, the albedo depends on the directional distribution of incident radiation, except for </entity/>Lambertian-reflectance </mention/>Lambertian-surfaces, which scatter radiation in all directions according to a cosine function and therefore have an albedo that is independent of the incident distribution. In practice, a </entity/>bidirectional-reflectance-distribution-function bidirectional-reflectance-distribution-function (BRDF) may be required to accurately characterize the scattering properties of a surface, but albedo is very useful as a first approximation.
The albedo is an important concept in </entity/>climatology climatology, </entity/>astronomy astronomy, and calculating </entity/>reflectivity reflectivity of surfaces in </entity/>Leadership-in-Energy-and-Environmental-Design </mention/>LEED sustainable-rating systems for buildings. The average overall albedo of Earth, its "planetary albedo", is 30 to 35% because of cloud cover, but widely varies locally across the surface because of different geological and environmental features.
The term was introduced into optics by </entity/>Johann-Heinrich-Lambert Johann-Heinrich-Lambert in his 1760 work "</entity/>Photometria Photometria".
Terrestrial albedo.
Albedos of typical materials in visible light range from up to 0.9 for fresh snow to about 0.04 for charcoal, one of the darkest substances. Deeply shadowed cavities can achieve an effective albedo approaching the zero of a </entity/>black-body black-body. When seen from a distance, the ocean surface has a low albedo, as do most forests, whereas desert areas have some of the highest albedos among landforms. Most land areas are in an albedo range of 0.1 to 0.4. The average albedo of the </entity/>Earth Earth is about 0.3. This is far higher than for the ocean primarily because of the contribution of clouds.

Earth's surface albedo is regularly estimated via </entity/>Earth-observation Earth-observation satellite sensors such as </entity/>NASA NASA's </entity/>MODIS MODIS instruments on board the </entity/>Terra-(satellite) </mention/>Terra and </entity/>Aqua-(satellite) </mention/>Aqua satellites. As the total amount of reflected radiation cannot be directly measured by satellite, a </entity/>mathematical-model mathematical-model of the BRDF is used to translate a sample set of satellite reflectance measurements into estimates of </entity/>directional-hemispherical-reflectance directional-hemispherical-reflectance and bi-hemispherical reflectance (e.g.).
Earth's average surface temperature due to its albedo and the </entity/>greenhouse-effect greenhouse-effect is currently about 15 °C. If Earth were frozen entirely (and hence be more reflective) the average temperature of the planet would drop below −40 °C. If only the continental land masses became covered by glaciers, the mean temperature of the planet would drop to about 0 °C. In contrast, if the entire Earth is covered by water—a so-called aquaplanet—the average temperature on the planet would rise to just under 27 °C.
White-sky and black-sky albedo.
It has been shown that for many applications involving terrestrial albedo, the albedo at a particular </entity/>solar-zenith-angle solar-zenith-angle "θ""i" can reasonably be approximated by the proportionate sum of two terms: the directional-hemispherical reflectance at that solar zenith angle, formula_1, and the bi-hemispherical reflectance, formula_2 the proportion concerned being defined as the proportion of diffuse illumination formula_3.
Albedo formula_4 can then be given as:
</entity/>Directional-hemispherical-reflectance Directional-hemispherical-reflectance is sometimes referred to as black-sky albedo and </entity/>bi-hemispherical-reflectance bi-hemispherical-reflectance as white-sky albedo. These terms are important because they allow the albedo to be calculated for any given illumination conditions from a knowledge of the intrinsic properties of the surface.
Astronomical albedo.
The albedos of </entity/>planet planets, </entity/>Natural-satellite </mention/>satellites and </entity/>asteroid asteroids can be used to infer much about their properties. The study of albedos, their dependence on wavelength, lighting angle ("phase angle"), and variation in time comprises a major part of the astronomical field of </entity/>photometry-(astronomy) </mention/>photometry. For small and far objects that cannot be resolved by telescopes, much of what we know comes from the study of their albedos. For example, the absolute albedo can indicate the surface ice content of outer </entity/>Solar-System Solar-System objects, the variation of albedo with phase angle gives information about </entity/>regolith regolith properties, whereas unusually high radar albedo is indicative of high metal content in </entity/>asteroid asteroids.
</entity/>Enceladus Enceladus, a moon of Saturn, has one of the highest known albedos of any body in the Solar System, with 99% of EM radiation reflected. Another notable high-albedo body is </entity/>Eris-(dwarf-planet) </mention/>Eris, with an albedo of 0.96. Many small objects in the outer Solar System and </entity/>asteroid-belt asteroid-belt have low albedos down to about 0.05. A typical </entity/>comet-nucleus comet-nucleus has an albedo of 0.04. Such a dark surface is thought to be indicative of a primitive and heavily </entity/>space-weathering </mention/>space-weathered surface containing some </entity/>organic-compound organic-compounds.
The overall albedo of the </entity/>Moon Moon is around 0.12, but it is strongly directional and non-Lambertian, displaying also a strong </entity/>opposition-effect opposition-effect. Although such reflectance properties are different from those of any terrestrial terrains, they are typical of the </entity/>regolith regolith surfaces of airless Solar System bodies.
Two common albedos that are used in astronomy are the (V-band) </entity/>geometric-albedo geometric-albedo (measuring brightness when illumination comes from directly behind the observer) and the </entity/>Bond-albedo Bond-albedo (measuring total proportion of electromagnetic energy reflected). Their values can differ significantly, which is a common source of confusion.
In detailed studies, the directional reflectance properties of astronomical bodies are often expressed in terms of the five </entity/>Hapke-parameters Hapke-parameters which semi-empirically describe the variation of albedo with </entity/>phase-angle-(astronomy) </mention/>phase-angle, including a characterization of the opposition effect of </entity/>regolith regolith surfaces.
The correlation between astronomical (geometric) albedo, </entity/>Absolute-magnitude#Absolute-magnitude-for-planets-(H) </mention/>absolute-magnitude and diameter is:
formula_6,
where formula_7 is the astronomical albedo, formula_8 is the diameter in kilometers, and formula_9 is the absolute magnitude.
Examples of terrestrial albedo effects.
Illumination.
Although the albedo–temperature effect is best known in colder, whiter regions on Earth, the maximum albedo is actually found in the tropics where year-round illumination is greater. The maximum is additionally in the northern hemisphere, varying between three and twelve degrees north. The minima are found in the subtropical regions of the northern and southern hemispheres, beyond which albedo increases without respect to illumination.
Insolation effects.
The intensity of albedo temperature effects depend on the amount of albedo and the level of local </entity/>insolation insolation; high albedo areas in the </entity/>arctic arctic and </entity/>antarctic antarctic regions are cold due to low insolation, where areas such as the </entity/>Sahara-Desert Sahara-Desert, which also have a relatively high albedo, will be hotter due to high insolation. </entity/>Tropical Tropical and </entity/>sub-tropical sub-tropical </entity/>rain-forest rain-forest areas have low albedo, and are much hotter than their </entity/>temperate-forest temperate-forest counterparts, which have lower insolation. Because insolation plays such a big role in the heating and cooling effects of albedo, high insolation areas like the tropics will tend to show a more pronounced fluctuation in local temperature when local albedo changes. 
Climate and weather.
Albedo affects </entity/>climate climate and drives </entity/>weather weather. All weather is a result of the uneven heating of Earth caused by different areas of the planet having different albedos. Essentially, for the driving of weather, there are two types of albedo regions on Earth: Land and ocean. Land and ocean regions produce the four basic different types of </entity/>air-masses air-masses, depending on latitude and therefore </entity/>insolation insolation: Warm and dry, which form over tropical and sub-tropical land masses; warm and wet, which form over tropical and sub-tropical oceans; cold and dry which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar land masses; and cold and wet, which form over temperate, polar and sub-polar oceans. Different temperatures between the air masses result in different air pressures, and the masses develop into </entity/>pressure-systems pressure-systems. High pressure systems flow toward lower pressure, driving weather from north to south in the northern hemisphere, and south to north in the lower; however due to the spinning of Earth, the </entity/>Coriolis-effect Coriolis-effect further complicates flow and creates several weather/climate bands and the </entity/>jet-stream jet-streams.
Albedo–temperature feedback.
When an area's albedo changes due to snowfall, a snow–temperature </entity/>feedback feedback results. A layer of snowfall increases local albedo, reflecting away sunlight, leading to local cooling. In principle, if no outside temperature change affects this area (e.g. a warm </entity/>air-mass air-mass), the lowered albedo and lower temperature would maintain the current snow and invite further snowfall, deepening the snow–temperature feedback. However, because local </entity/>weather weather is dynamic due to the change of </entity/>seasons seasons, eventually warm air masses and a more direct angle of sunlight (higher </entity/>insolation insolation) cause melting. When the melted area reveals surfaces with lower albedo, such as grass or soil, the effect is reversed: the darkening surface lowers albedo, increasing local temperatures, which induces more melting and thus reducing the albedo further, resulting in still more heating.
Small-scale effects.
Albedo works on a smaller scale, too. In sunlight, dark clothes absorb more heat and light-coloured clothes reflect it better, thus allowing some control over body temperature by exploiting the albedo effect of the colour of external clothing.
Solar photovoltaic effects.
Albedo can affect the </entity/>electrical-energy electrical-energy output of solar </entity/>photovoltaic-system </mention/>photovoltaic-devices (PV). For example, the effects of a spectrally responsive albedo are illustrated by the differences between the spectrally weighted albedo of solar PV technology based on hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) and crystalline silicon (c-Si)-based compared to traditional spectral-integrated albedo predictions. Research showed impacts of over 10%. More recently, the analysis was extended to the effects of spectral bias due to the specular reflectivity of 22 commonly occurring surface materials (both human-made and natural) and analyzes the albedo effects on the performance of seven PV materials covering three common PV system topologies: industrial (solar farms), commercial flat rooftops and residential pitched-roof applications.
Trees.
Because forests generally have a low albedo, (the majority of the ultraviolet and visible spectrum is absorbed through </entity/>photosynthesis photosynthesis), some scientists have suggested that greater heat absorption by trees could offset some of the carbon benefits of afforestation (or offset the negative climate impacts of deforestation). In the case of evergreen forests with seasonal snow cover albedo reduction may be great enough for deforestation to cause a net cooling effect. Trees also impact climate in extremely complicated ways through </entity/>evapotranspiration evapotranspiration. The water vapor causes cooling on the land surface, causes heating where it condenses, acts a strong greenhouse gas, and can increase alebedo when it condenses into clouds Scientists generally treat evapotranspiration as a net cooling impact, and the net climate impact of albedo and evapotranspiration changes from deforestation depends greatly on local climate 
In seasonally snow-covered zones, winter albedos of treeless areas are 10% to 50% higher than nearby forested areas because snow does not cover the trees as readily. </entity/>Deciduous-trees Deciduous-trees have an albedo value of about 0.15 to 0.18 whereas </entity/>coniferous-trees coniferous-trees have a value of about 0.09 to 0.15.
Studies by the </entity/>Hadley-Centre Hadley-Centre have investigated the relative (generally warming) effect of albedo change and (cooling) effect of </entity/>carbon-sequestration carbon-sequestration on planting forests. They found that new forests in tropical and midlatitude areas tended to cool; new forests in high latitudes (e.g. Siberia) were neutral or perhaps warming.
Snow.
Snow albedo is highly variable, ranging from as high as 0.9 for freshly fallen snow, to about 0.4 for melting snow, and as low as 0.2 for dirty snow. Over </entity/>Antarctica Antarctica they average a little more than 0.8. If a marginally snow-covered area warms, snow tends to melt, lowering the albedo, and hence leading to more snowmelt because more radiation is being absorbed by the snowpack (the ice-albedo </entity/>positive-feedback positive-feedback). </entity/>Cryoconite Cryoconite, powdery windblown </entity/>dust dust containing soot, sometimes reduces albedo on glaciers and ice sheets.
Hence, small errors in albedo can lead to large errors in energy estimates, which is why it is important to measure the albedo of snow-covered areas through remote sensing techniques rather than applying a single value over broad regions.
Water.
Water reflects light very differently from typical terrestrial materials. The reflectivity of a water surface is calculated using the </entity/>Fresnel-equations Fresnel-equations (see graph).
</entity/>
At the scale of the wavelength of light even wavy water is always smooth so the light is reflected in a locally </entity/>specular-reflection </mention/>specular-manner (not </entity/>Diffuse-reflection </mention/>diffusely). The glint of light off water is a commonplace effect of this. At small </entity/>angle-of-incidence </mention/>angles-of-incident light, </entity/>waviness waviness results in reduced reflectivity because of the steepness of the reflectivity-vs.-incident-angle curve and a locally increased average incident angle.
Although the reflectivity of water is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light such as those that occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the </entity/>terminator-(solar) </mention/>terminator (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered to have a very low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.
Note that white caps on waves look white (and have high albedo) because the water is foamed up, so there are many superimposed bubble surfaces which reflect, adding up their reflectivities. Fresh 'black' ice exhibits Fresnel reflection.
Clouds.
</entity/>Cloud-albedo Cloud-albedo has substantial influence over atmospheric temperatures. Different types of clouds exhibit different reflectivity, theoretically ranging in albedo from a minimum of near 0 to a maximum approaching 0.8. "On any given day, about half of Earth is covered by clouds, which reflect more sunlight than land and water. Clouds keep Earth cool by reflecting sunlight, but they can also serve as blankets to trap warmth."
Albedo and climate in some areas are affected by artificial clouds, such as those created by the </entity/>contrail contrails of heavy commercial airliner traffic. A study following the burning of the Kuwaiti oil fields during Iraqi occupation showed that temperatures under the burning oil fires were as much as 10 °C colder than temperatures several miles away under clear skies.
Aerosol effects.
</entity/>Aerosols Aerosols (very fine particles/droplets in the atmosphere) have both direct and indirect effects on Earth's radiative balance. The direct (albedo) effect is generally to cool the planet; the indirect effect (the particles act as </entity/>cloud-condensation-nuclei cloud-condensation-nuclei and thereby change cloud properties) is less certain. As per the effects are:
Black carbon.
Another albedo-related effect on the climate is from </entity/>black-carbon black-carbon particles. The size of this effect is difficult to quantify: the </entity/>Intergovernmental-Panel-on-Climate-Change Intergovernmental-Panel-on-Climate-Change estimates that the global mean radiative forcing for black carbon aerosols from fossil fuels is +0.2 W m−2, with a range +0.1 to +0.4 W m−2. Black carbon is a bigger cause of the melting of the polar ice cap in the Arctic than carbon dioxide due to its effect on the albedo.
Human activities.
Human activities (e.g. deforestation, farming, and urbanization) change the albedo of various areas around the globe. However, quantification of this effect on the global scale is difficult.
Other types of albedo.
</entity/>Single-scattering-albedo Single-scattering-albedo is used to define scattering of electromagnetic waves on small particles. It depends on properties of the material (</entity/>refractive-index refractive-index); the size of the particle or particles; and the wavelength of the incoming radiation.

A

</entity/>
A (</entity/>English-alphabet#Letter-names </mention/>named "a" , plural "aes") is the first </entity/>Letter-(alphabet) </mention/>letter and </entity/>vowel vowel in the </entity/>ISO-basic-Latin-alphabet ISO-basic-Latin-alphabet. It is similar to the Ancient Greek letter </entity/>alpha alpha, from which it derives. The upper-case version consists of the two slanting sides of a triangle, crossed in the middle by a horizontal bar. The lower-case version can be written in two forms: the double-storey a and single-storey ɑ. The latter is commonly used in handwriting and fonts based on it, especially fonts intended to be read by children. It is also found in </entity/>italic-type italic-type.
History.
The earliest certain ancestor of "A" is </entity/>aleph aleph (also called 'aleph), the first letter of the </entity/>Phoenician-alphabet Phoenician-alphabet (which, by consisting entirely of </entity/>consonant consonants, is an </entity/>abjad abjad rather than a true </entity/>alphabet alphabet). In turn, the origin of aleph may have been a </entity/>pictogram pictogram of an ox head in </entity/>proto-Sinaitic-script proto-Sinaitic-script influenced by </entity/>Egyptian-hieroglyphs Egyptian-hieroglyphs, styled as a triangular head with two horns extended.
In 1600 B.C.E., the Phoenician alphabet's letter had a linear form that served as the base for some later forms. Its name must have corresponded closely to the </entity/>Hebrew-alphabet </mention/>Hebrew or </entity/>Arabic-script </mention/>Arabic aleph.
When the </entity/>Ancient-Greece </mention/>ancient-Greeks adopted the alphabet, they had no use for the </entity/>glottal-stop glottal-stop—the first </entity/>phoneme phoneme of the Phoenician pronunciation of the letter, and the sound that the letter denoted in </entity/>Phoenician-language </mention/>Phoenician and other </entity/>Semitic-languages Semitic-languages—so they used an adaptation of the sign to represent the vowel , and gave it the similar name of </entity/>alpha alpha. In the earliest Greek inscriptions after the </entity/>Greek-Dark-Ages Greek-Dark-Ages, dating to the 8th century BC, the letter rests upon its side, but in the </entity/>Greek-alphabet Greek-alphabet of later times it generally resembles the modern capital letter, although many local varieties can be distinguished by the shortening of one leg, or by the angle at which the cross line is set.
The </entity/>Etruscan-civilization </mention/>Etruscans brought the Greek alphabet to their civilization in the </entity/>Italian-Peninsula Italian-Peninsula and left the letter unchanged. The Romans later adopted the </entity/>Old-Italic-script </mention/>Etruscan-alphabet to write the </entity/>Latin </mention/>Latin-language, and the resulting letter was preserved in the </entity/>Latin-script </mention/>Latin-alphabet used to write many languages, including English.
Typographic variants.
</entity/>
During Roman times, there were many variations on the letter "A". First was the monumental or lapidary style, which was used when inscribing on stone or other "permanent" mediums. For perishable surfaces, what was used for everyday or utilitarian purposes, a </entity/>cursive cursive style was used. Due to the "perishable" nature of the surfaces, these examples are not as prevalent as the monumental. This perishable style was called cursive and numerous variations have survived, such as </entity/>letter-case </mention/>majuscule cursive, </entity/>letter-case </mention/>minuscule cursive, and semicursive minuscule. There were also variants that were intermediate between the monumental and the cursive. The known variants include the early </entity/>Uncial-script#Half-uncial </mention/>semi-uncial, the uncial, and the later semi-uncial.
At the termination of the </entity/>Roman-Empire Roman-Empire (5th century AD), several variants of the cursive minuscule appeared through Western Europe. Among these were the semicursive minuscule of </entity/>Italy Italy, the </entity/>Merovingian-script Merovingian-script in France, the </entity/>Visigothic-script Visigothic-script in Spain, and the </entity/>Insular-script </mention/>Insular or Anglo-Irish semi-uncial or Anglo-Saxon majuscule, of Great Britain. By the 9th century, the </entity/>Carolingian-minuscule </mention/>Caroline-script, which was very similar to the present-day form, was the principal form used in book-making, before the advent of the printing press. This form was derived through a combining of prior forms.
15th-century Italy saw the formation of the two variants that are known today. These variants, the "Italics" and "Roman" forms, were derived from the Caroline Script version. The Italics form used in most current </entity/>handwriting handwriting consists of a circle and vertical stroke (), called </entity/>Latin-alpha Latin-alpha or "script a". This slowly developed from the fifth-century form resembling the Greek letter </entity/>tau tau in the hands of dark-age Irish and English writers. Most printed material uses the Roman form consisting of a small loop with an arc over it (). Both derive from the majuscule (capital) form. In Greek handwriting, it was common to join the left leg and horizontal stroke into a single loop, as demonstrated by the uncial version shown. Many fonts then made the right leg vertical. In some of these, the </entity/>serif serif that began the right leg stroke developed into an arc, resulting in the printed form, while in others it was dropped, resulting in the modern handwritten form.
Use in English.
In </entity/>English-orthography English-orthography, the letter A currently represents six different vowel sounds: A by itself frequently denotes the </entity/>near-open-front-unrounded-vowel near-open-front-unrounded-vowel () as in "pad"; the </entity/>open-back-unrounded-vowel open-back-unrounded-vowel () as in "father", its original, Latin and Greek, sound; a closer, further fronted sound as in "hare", which developed as the sound progressed from "father" to "ace"; in concert with a later orthographic vowel, the diphthong as in "ace" and "major", due to effects of the </entity/>Great-Vowel-Shift Great-Vowel-Shift; the more rounded form in "water" or its closely related cousin, found in "was".
The double "a" sequence is not a native English combination; however it occurs in some foreign words such as "Aaron" and "aardvark".
"A" is the third-most-commonly used letter in English (after "E" and "T"), and the second most common in Spanish and French. In one study, on average, about 3.68% of letters used in English tend to be 'a', while the number is 6.22% in Spanish and 3.95% in French.
Use in other languages.
In most languages that use the Latin alphabet, A denotes an open unrounded vowel: , , or . An exception is </entity/>Saanich-dialect </mention/>Saanich, in which A (and </entity/>Á Á) stands for a </entity/>close-mid-front-unrounded-vowel close-mid-front-unrounded-vowel .
Use in mathematics, logic and science.
In </entity/>algebra algebra, the letter "A" along with other letters at the beginning of the alphabet is used to represent known quantities, whereas the letters at the end of the alphabet (x,y,z) are used to denote unknown quantities.
In </entity/>geometry geometry, capital A, B, C etc. are used to denote </entity/>Line-segment </mention/>segments, </entity/>line-(geometry) </mention/>lines, </entity/>Line-(geometry)#Ray </mention/>rays, etc. Also, A is typically used as one of the letters to represent an angle in a </entity/>triangle triangle.
In </entity/>logic logic, A is used to signify the </entity/>Categorical-proposition </mention/>universal-affirmative.
In </entity/>physics physics, A is the </entity/>SI SI unit symbol for </entity/>Ampere Ampere.
In phonetic and phonemic notation:
Other uses.
"A" is often used to denote something or someone of a better or more prestigious quality or status: A-, A or A+, the best grade that can be assigned by teachers for students' schoolwork; "A grade" for clean restaurants; </entity/>A-list A-list celebrities, etc. Such associations can have a </entity/>motivation </mention/>motivating effect, as exposure to the letter A has been found to improve performance, when compared with other letters.
A is a common symbol of school and basic phonetics in the US, along with </entity/>B B and </entity/>C C.
Finally, the letter A is used to denote size, as in a narrow size shoe, or a small cup size in a </entity/>brassiere brassiere.

Alabama

Alabama () is a state located in the </entity/>Southern-United-States </mention/>southeastern-region of the United States. It is bordered by </entity/>Tennessee Tennessee to the north, </entity/>Georgia-(U.S.-state) </mention/>Georgia to the east, </entity/>Florida Florida and the </entity/>Gulf-of-Mexico Gulf-of-Mexico to the south, and </entity/>Mississippi Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the </entity/>List-of-U.S.-states-and-territories-by-area </mention/>30th-most-extensive and the </entity/>List-of-U.S.-states-and-territories-by-population </mention/>23rd-most-populous of the </entity/>List-of-U.S.-states </mention/>50-United-States. At , Alabama has one of the longest navigable inland waterways in the nation.
From the </entity/>American-Civil-War American-Civil-War until </entity/>World-War-II World-War-II, Alabama, like many Southern states, suffered economic hardship, in part because of continued dependence on agriculture. Despite the growth of major industries and urban centers, </entity/>White-American </mention/>White rural interests dominated the state legislature until the 1960s, while urban interests and African Americans were under-represented. African Americans and poor whites were essentially disfranchised in 1901, a status that continued into the 1960s.
Following World War II, Alabama experienced growth as the economy of the state transitioned from one primarily based on agriculture to one with diversified interests. The establishment or expansion of multiple </entity/>United-States-Armed-Forces United-States-Armed-Forces installations added to the state economy and helped bridge the gap between an agricultural and industrial economy during the mid-20th century. The state economy in the 21st century is dependent on management, automotive, finance, manufacturing, aerospace, mineral extraction, healthcare, education, retail, and technology.
Alabama is unofficially nicknamed the "</entity/>Northern-Flicker </mention/>Yellowhammer State", after the </entity/>List-of-U.S.-state-birds </mention/>state-bird. Alabama is also known as the "Heart of </entity/>Dixie Dixie" and the "</entity/>Cotton Cotton State". The </entity/>List-of-U.S.-state-trees </mention/>state-tree is the </entity/>Longleaf-Pine Longleaf-Pine, and the </entity/>List-of-U.S.-state-flowers </mention/>state-flower is the </entity/>Camellia Camellia. The capital of Alabama is </entity/>Montgomery,-Alabama </mention/>Montgomery. The largest city by population is </entity/>Birmingham,-Alabama </mention/>Birmingham, and largest city by total land area is </entity/>Huntsville,-Alabama </mention/>Huntsville. The oldest city is </entity/>Mobile,-Alabama </mention/>Mobile, founded by French </entity/>colonists colonists.
Etymology.
</entity/>
The European-American naming of the </entity/>Alabama-River Alabama-River and state originates from the </entity/>Alabama-people Alabama-people, a </entity/>Muskogean-languages </mention/>Muskogean-speaking-tribe whose members lived just below the confluence of the </entity/>Coosa-River </mention/>Coosa and </entity/>Tallapoosa-River </mention/>Tallapoosa rivers on the upper reaches of the river. In the </entity/>Alabama-language Alabama-language, the word for an Alabama person is "Albaamo" (or variously "Albaama" or "Albàamo" in different dialects; the plural form is "Albaamaha").
The word "Alabama" is believed to have come from the related </entity/>Choctaw-language Choctaw-language and was adopted by the Alabama tribe as their name. The spelling of the word varies significantly among historical sources. The first usage appears in three accounts of the </entity/>Hernando-de-Soto Hernando-de-Soto expedition of 1540 with </entity/>Garcilaso-de-la-Vega-(chronicler) </mention/>Garcilaso-de-la-Vega using "Alibamo", while the Knight of Elvas and Rodrigo Ranjel wrote "Alibamu" and "Limamu", respectively, in efforts to </entity/>Transliteration </mention/>transliterate the term. As early as 1702, the French called the tribe the "Alibamon," with French maps identifying the river as "Rivière des Alibamons". Other spellings of the appellation have included "Alibamu", "Alabamo", "Albama", "Alebamon", "Alibama", "Alibamou", "Alabamu", and "Allibamou".
Sources disagree on the meaning of the word. An 1842 article in the "Jacksonville Republican" proposed that it meant "Here We Rest." This notion was popularized in the 1850s through the writings of </entity/>Alexander-Beaufort-Meek Alexander-Beaufort-Meek. Experts in the </entity/>Muskogean-languages Muskogean-languages have been unable to find any evidence to support such a translation.
Scholars believe the word comes from the Choctaw "alba" (meaning "plants" or "weeds") and "amo" (meaning "to cut", "to trim", or "to gather"). The meaning may have been "clearers of the thicket" or "herb gatherers", referring to clearing land for cultivation or collecting medicinal plants. The state has numerous </entity/>List-of-place-names-in-Alabama-of-Native-American-origin </mention/>place-names-of-Native-American-origin.
History.
Pre-European settlement.
</entity/>Indigenous-peoples Indigenous-peoples of varying cultures lived in the area for thousands of years before European colonization. Trade with the northeastern tribes via the </entity/>Ohio-River Ohio-River began during the Burial Mound Period (1000 BC–AD 700) and continued until </entity/>European-colonization-of-the-Americas </mention/>European-contact.
</entity/>
The agrarian </entity/>Mississippian-culture Mississippian-culture covered most of the state from 1000 to 1600 AD, with one of its major centers built at what is now the </entity/>Moundville-Archaeological-Site Moundville-Archaeological-Site in </entity/>Moundville,-Alabama Moundville,-Alabama. Analysis of </entity/>Artifact-(archaeology) </mention/>artifacts recovered from </entity/>archaeological archaeological excavations at Moundville were the basis of scholars' formulating the characteristics of the </entity/>Southeastern-Ceremonial-Complex Southeastern-Ceremonial-Complex (SECC). Contrary to popular belief, the SECC appears to have no direct links to </entity/>Mesoamerica Mesoamerican culture, but developed independently. The Ceremonial Complex represents a major component of the religion of the Mississippian peoples; it is one of the primary means by which their religion is understood.
Among the historical tribes of Native American people living in the area of present-day Alabama at the time of European contact were the </entity/>Cherokee Cherokee, an </entity/>Iroquoian-language Iroquoian-language people; and the </entity/>Muskogean Muskogean-speaking </entity/>Alabama-(people) </mention/>Alabama ("Alibamu"), </entity/>Chickasaw Chickasaw, </entity/>Choctaw Choctaw, </entity/>Creek-people </mention/>Creek, and </entity/>Koasati Koasati. While part of the same large language family, the Muskogee tribes developed distinct cultures and languages.
European settlement.
With exploration in the 16th century, the Spanish were the first Europeans to reach Alabama. The expedition of </entity/>Hernando-de-Soto Hernando-de-Soto passed through </entity/>Mabila Mabila and other parts of the state in 1540. More than 160 years later, the French founded the first European settlement in the region at </entity/>Old-Mobile-Site </mention/>Old-Mobile in 1702. The city was moved to the current site of </entity/>Mobile,-Alabama </mention/>Mobile in 1711. This area was claimed by the French from 1702 to 1763 as part of </entity/>La-Louisiane La-Louisiane.
After the French lost to the British in the </entity/>Seven-Years'-War Seven-Years'-War, it became part of British </entity/>West-Florida West-Florida from 1763 to 1783. After the United States victory in the </entity/>American-Revolutionary-War American-Revolutionary-War, the territory was divided between the United States and Spain. The latter retained control of this western territory from 1783 until the surrender of the Spanish garrison at Mobile to U.S. forces on April 13, 1813.
Thomas Bassett, a </entity/>Loyalist-(American-Revolution) </mention/>loyalist to the British monarchy during the Revolutionary era, was one of the earliest White settlers in the state outside Mobile. He settled in the </entity/>Tombigbee-District Tombigbee-District during the early 1770s. The boundaries of the district were roughly limited to the area within a few miles of the </entity/>Tombigbee-River Tombigbee-River and included portions of what is today southern </entity/>Clarke-County,-Alabama </mention/>Clarke-County, northernmost </entity/>Mobile-County,-Alabama </mention/>Mobile-County, and most of </entity/>Washington-County,-Alabama </mention/>Washington-County.
What is now the counties of </entity/>Baldwin-County,-Alabama </mention/>Baldwin and </entity/>Mobile-County,-Alabama </mention/>Mobile became part of </entity/>Spanish-West-Florida Spanish-West-Florida in 1783, part of the independent </entity/>Republic-of-West-Florida Republic-of-West-Florida in 1810, and was finally added to the </entity/>Mississippi-Territory Mississippi-Territory in 1812. Most of what is now the northern two-thirds of Alabama was known as the </entity/>Yazoo-lands Yazoo-lands beginning during the British colonial period. It was claimed by the </entity/>Province-of-Georgia Province-of-Georgia from 1767 onwards. Following the </entity/>American-Revolution </mention/>Revolutionary-War, it remained a part of </entity/>Georgia-(U.S.-state) </mention/>Georgia, although heavily disputed.

With the exception of the immediate area around Mobile and the Yazoo lands, what is now the lower one-third Alabama was made part of the Mississippi Territory when it was organized in 1798. The Yazoo lands were added to the territory in 1804, following the </entity/>Yazoo-land-scandal Yazoo-land-scandal.

19th century.
Prior to the admission of </entity/>Mississippi Mississippi as a state on December 10, 1817, the more sparsely settled eastern half of the territory was separated and named the </entity/>Alabama-Territory Alabama-Territory. The Alabama Territory was created by the </entity/>United-States-Congress United-States-Congress on March 3, 1817. </entity/>St.-Stephens,-Alabama </mention/>St.-Stephens, now abandoned, served as the territorial capital from 1817 to 1819.
The U.S. Congress selected Huntsville as the site for the first Constitutional Convention of Alabama after it was approved to become the 22nd state. From July 5 to August 2, 1819, delegates met to prepare the new state constitution. Huntsville served as the temporary capital of Alabama from 1819 to 1820, when the seat of state government was moved to </entity/>Cahaba,-Alabama </mention/>Cahaba in </entity/>Dallas-County,-Alabama </mention/>Dallas-County.
</entity/>
Cahaba, now a ghost town, was the first permanent state capital from 1820 to 1825. </entity/>Alabama-Fever Alabama-Fever was already underway when the state was admitted to the Union, with settlers and land speculators pouring into the state to take advantage of fertile land suitable for cotton cultivation. Part of the frontier in the 1820s and 1830s, its constitution provided for universal suffrage for White men.
Southeastern planters and traders from the </entity/>Upper-South Upper-South brought </entity/>History-of-slavery-in-Alabama </mention/>slaves with them as the cotton </entity/>List-of-plantations-in-Alabama </mention/>plantations-in-Alabama expanded. The economy of the central </entity/>Black-Belt-(region-of-Alabama) </mention/>Black-Belt (named for its dark, productive soil) was built around large cotton </entity/>Plantation-complexes-in-the-Southeastern-United-States </mention/>plantations whose owners' wealth grew largely from slave labor. The area also drew many poor, disfranchised people who became </entity/>subsistence-farmers subsistence-farmers. Alabama had a population estimated at under 10,000 people in 1810, but it had increased to more than 300,000 people by 1830. Most Native American tribes were </entity/>Indian-removal </mention/>completely-removed from the state within a few years of the passage of the </entity/>Indian-Removal-Act Indian-Removal-Act by Congress in 1830.
</entity/>
From 1826 to 1846, </entity/>Tuscaloosa,-Alabama </mention/>Tuscaloosa served as the capital of Alabama. On January 30, 1846, the Alabama legislature announced that it had voted to move the capital city from Tuscaloosa to </entity/>Montgomery,-Alabama </mention/>Montgomery. The first legislative session in the new capital met in December 1847. A new capitol building was erected under the direction of </entity/>Stephen-Decatur-Button Stephen-Decatur-Button of </entity/>Philadelphia Philadelphia. The first structure burned down in 1849, but was rebuilt on the same site in 1851. This second capitol building in Montgomery remains to the present day. It was designed by Barachias Holt of </entity/>Exeter,-Maine Exeter,-Maine.
By 1860, the population had increased to a total of 964,201 people, of which nearly half, 435,080 were enslaved African Americans, and 2,690 were </entity/>free-people-of-color free-people-of-color. On January 11, 1861, Alabama declared its </entity/>Secession-in-the-United-States </mention/>secession from the </entity/>Union-(American-Civil-War) </mention/>Union. After remaining an independent republic for a few days, it joined the </entity/>Confederate-States-of-America Confederate-States-of-America. The Confederacy's capital was initially located at </entity/>Montgomery,-Alabama </mention/>Montgomery. Alabama was heavily </entity/>Alabama-in-the-American-Civil-War </mention/>involved-in-the-American-Civil-War. Although comparatively few battles were fought in the state, Alabama contributed about 120,000 soldiers to the war effort.

A company of cavalry soldiers from Huntsville, Alabama joined </entity/>Nathan-Bedford-Forrest Nathan-Bedford-Forrest's battalion in </entity/>Hopkinsville,-Kentucky Hopkinsville,-Kentucky. The company wore new uniforms with yellow trim on the sleeves, collar and coat tails. This led to them being greeted with "Yellowhammer", and the name later was applied to all Alabama troops in the Confederate Army.
Alabama's slaves were freed by the 13th Amendment in 1865. Alabama was under military rule from the end of the war in May 1865 until its official restoration to the Union in 1868. From 1867 to 1874, with most White citizens barred temporarily from voting, many African Americans emerged as political leaders in the state. Alabama was represented in Congress during this period by three African-American congressmen: </entity/>Jeremiah-Haralson Jeremiah-Haralson, </entity/>Benjamin-S.-Turner Benjamin-S.-Turner, and </entity/>James-T.-Rapier James-T.-Rapier.
Following the war, the state remained chiefly agricultural, with an economy tied to cotton. During </entity/>Reconstruction-era-of-the-United-States </mention/>Reconstruction, state legislators ratified a </entity/>Constitution-of-Alabama </mention/>new-state-constitution in 1868 that created the state's first public school system and expanded women's rights. Legislators funded numerous public road and railroad projects, although these were plagued with allegations of fraud and misappropriation. Organized </entity/>insurgent insurgent, resistance groups tried to suppress the freedmen and Republicans. Besides the short-lived original </entity/>Ku-Klux-Klan Ku-Klux-Klan, these included the Pale Faces, </entity/>Knights-of-the-White-Camellia Knights-of-the-White-Camellia, </entity/>Red-Shirts-(Southern-United-States) </mention/>Red-Shirts, and the </entity/>White-League White-League.
Reconstruction in Alabama ended in 1874, when the Democrats regained control of the legislature and governor's office. They wrote another constitution in 1875, and the legislature passed the </entity/>Blaine-Amendment Blaine-Amendment, prohibiting public money from being used to finance religious-affiliated schools. The same year, legislation was approved that called for </entity/>racial-segregation </mention/>racially-segregated schools. Railroad passenger cars were segregated in 1891. Alabama passed more </entity/>Jim-Crow-laws Jim-Crow-laws at the beginning of the 20th century to further encourage segregation in everyday life.
20th century.
</entity/>
The new 1901 </entity/>Constitution-of-Alabama Constitution-of-Alabama included electoral laws that effectively </entity/>Disfranchisement-after-Reconstruction-era </mention/>disfranchised African Americans, Native Americans, and most poor Whites through voting restrictions, including </entity/>Poll-tax-(United-States) </mention/>poll-taxes and </entity/>literacy-test literacy-test requirements. While the planter class had persuaded poor Whites to support these legislative efforts, the new restrictions resulted in their disfranchisement as well, due mostly to the imposition of a cumulative </entity/>poll-tax poll-tax.
In 1900, Alabama had more than 181,000 African Americans eligible to vote. By 1903, only 2,980 were qualified to register, although at least 74,000 African-American voters were </entity/>literate literate. By 1941, more White Alabamians than African-American residents had been disfranchised: a total of 600,000 Whites to 520,000 African Americans. Nearly all African Americans had lost the ability to vote, a situation that persisted until after passage of federal civil rights legislation in the 1965 to enforce their constitutional rights as citizens.
The 1901 constitution reiterated that schools be racially segregated. It also restated that interracial marriage was illegal, although such marriages had been made illegal in 1867. Further racial segregation laws were passed related to public facilities into the 1950s: jails were segregated in 1911; hospitals in 1915; toilets, hotels, and restaurants in 1928; and bus stop waiting rooms in 1945.
The rural-dominated Alabama legislature consistently underfunded schools and services for the disfranchised African Americans, but it did not relieve them of paying taxes. Partially as a response to chronic underfunding of education for African Americans in the South, the </entity/>Rosenwald-Fund Rosenwald-Fund began funding the construction of what came to be known as </entity/>Rosenwald-School Rosenwald-Schools. In Alabama these schools were designed and the construction partially financed with Rosenwald funds, which paid one-third of the construction costs. The local community and state raised matching funds to pay the rest. Black residents effectively taxed themselves twice, by raising additional monies to supply matching funds for such schools, which were built in many rural areas.
</entity/>
Beginning in 1913, the first 80 </entity/>Rosenwald-School Rosenwald-Schools were built in Alabama for African-American children. A total of 387 schools, seven teacher's houses, and several vocational buildings had been completed in the state by 1937. Several of the </entity/>The-Rosenwald-School-Building-Fund-and-Associated-Buildings-Multiple-Property-Submission </mention/>surviving-school-buildings in the state are now listed on the </entity/>National-Register-of-Historic-Places National-Register-of-Historic-Places.
Continued racial discrimination, agricultural depression, and the failure of the cotton crops due to </entity/>boll-weevil boll-weevil infestation led tens of thousands of African Americans to seek opportunities in northern cities. They left Alabama in the early 20th century as part of the </entity/>Great-Migration-(African-American) </mention/>Great-Migration to industrial jobs and better futures in northern and midwestern industrial cities. Reflecting this emigration, the population growth rate in Alabama (see "Historical Populations" table below) dropped by nearly half from 1910 to 1920.
At the same time, many rural people, both White and African American, moved to the city of </entity/>Birmingham,-Alabama </mention/>Birmingham to work in new industrial jobs. Birmingham experienced such rapid growth that it was called "The Magic City". By the 1920s, Birmingham was the 19th-largest city in the United States and had more than 30% of the Alabama's population. Heavy industry and mining were the basis of its economy. Its residents were under-represented for decades in the state legislature, which refused to redistrict to recognize demographic changes, such as urbanization.
Industrial development related to the demands of World War II brought a level of prosperity to the state not seen since before the Civil War. Rural workers poured into the largest cities in the state for better jobs and a higher standard of living. One example of this massive influx of workers can be shown by what happened in Mobile. Between 1940 and 1943, more than 89,000 people moved into the city to work for war effort industries. Cotton and other cash crops faded in importance as the state developed a manufacturing and service base.
Despite massive population changes in the state from 1901 to 1961, the rural-dominated legislature refused to reapportion House and Senate seats based on population. They held on to old representation to maintain political and economic power in agricultural areas. In addition, the state legislature gerrymandered the few Birmingham legislative seats to ensure election by persons living outside Birmingham.
</entity/>
One result was that </entity/>Jefferson-County,-Alabama </mention/>Jefferson-County, containing Birmingham's industrial and economic powerhouse, contributed more than one-third of all tax revenue to the state, but did not receive a proportional amount in services. Urban interests were consistently underrepresented in the legislature. A 1960 study noted that because of rural domination, "a minority of about 25 per cent of the total state population is in majority control of the Alabama legislature."
African Americans were presumed partial to </entity/>Republican-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Republicans for historical reasons, but they were disfranchised. White Alabamans felt bitter towards the Republican Party in the aftermath of the Civil War and Reconstruction. These factors created a longstanding tradition that any candidate who wanted to be viable with White voters had to run as a </entity/>Democratic-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Democrat regardless of political beliefs.
Although efforts had already started decades earlier, African Americans began to press to end disfranchisement and segregation in the state during the 1950s and 1960s with the </entity/>African-American-Civil-Rights-Movement-(1955–1968) </mention/>Civil-Rights-Movement. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in "</entity/>Brown-v.-Board-of-Education Brown-v.-Board-of-Education" that public schools had to be desegregated, but Alabama was slow to comply. The civil rights movement raised national awareness of the issues, leading to the enactment of the </entity/>Civil-Rights-Act-of-1964 Civil-Rights-Act-of-1964 and </entity/>Voting-Rights-Act-of-1965 Voting-Rights-Act-of-1965 by the U.S. Congress. During the 1960s, under Governor </entity/>George-Wallace George-Wallace, Alabama attempted, but failed to resist compliance with federal demands for </entity/>desegregation desegregation.
During the Civil Rights Movement, African Americans achieved enforcement of voting and other civil constitutional rights through the passage of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964, and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Legal segregation ended in the states as </entity/>Jim-Crow-laws Jim-Crow-laws were invalidated or repealed.
Under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, cases were filed in Federal courts to force Alabama to redistrict by population both the House and Senate of the state legislature. In 1972, for the first time since 1901, the legislature implemented the Alabama constitution's provision for periodic redistricting based on population. This benefited the urban areas that had developed, as well as all in the population who had been underrepresented for more than 60 years.
Geography.
</entity/>
Alabama is the thirtieth-largest state in the United States with of total area: 3.2% of the area is water, making Alabama 23rd in the amount of surface water, also giving it the second-largest inland waterway system in the U.S. About three-fifths of the land area is a gentle plain with a general descent towards the </entity/>Mississippi-River Mississippi-River and the </entity/>Gulf-of-Mexico Gulf-of-Mexico. The </entity/>North-Alabama North-Alabama region is mostly mountainous, with the </entity/>Tennessee-River Tennessee-River cutting a large valley and creating numerous creeks, streams, rivers, mountains, and lakes.
Alabama is bordered by the states of </entity/>Tennessee Tennessee to the north, </entity/>Georgia-(U.S.-state) </mention/>Georgia to the east, </entity/>Florida Florida to the south, and </entity/>Mississippi Mississippi to the west. Alabama has coastline at the Gulf of Mexico, in the extreme southern edge of the state. The state ranges in elevation from sea level at </entity/>Mobile-Bay Mobile-Bay to over 1,800 feet (550 m) in the </entity/>Appalachian-Mountains Appalachian-Mountains in the northeast.
The highest point is </entity/>Mount-Cheaha Mount-Cheaha, at a height of . Alabama's land consists of of forest or 67% of total land area. Suburban </entity/>Baldwin-County,-Alabama </mention/>Baldwin-County, along the Gulf Coast, is the largest county in the state in both land area and water area.

A -wide meteorite impact crater is located in </entity/>Elmore-County,-Alabama </mention/>Elmore-County, just north of Montgomery. This is the </entity/>Wetumpka-crater Wetumpka-crater, the site of "Alabama's greatest natural disaster." A -wide meteorite hit the area about 80 million years ago. The hills just east of downtown </entity/>Wetumpka Wetumpka showcase the eroded remains of the impact crater that was blasted into the bedrock, with the area labeled the Wetumpka crater or astrobleme ("star-wound") because of the concentric rings of fractures and zones of shattered rock that can be found beneath the surface. In 2002, Christian Koeberl with the Institute of Geochemistry University of Vienna published evidence and established the site as the 157th recognized impact crater on Earth.
Climate.
</entity/>
The state is classified as </entity/>humid-subtropical-climate </mention/>humid-subtropical ("Cfa") under the </entity/>Humid-temperate-climate </mention/>Koppen-Climate-Classification. The average annual temperature is 64 °F (18 °C). Temperatures tend to be warmer in the southern part of the state with its proximity to the Gulf of Mexico, while the northern parts of the state, especially in the Appalachian Mountains in the northeast, tend to be slightly cooler. Generally, Alabama has very hot summers and mild winters with copious precipitation throughout the year. Alabama receives an average of of rainfall annually and enjoys a lengthy growing season of up to 300 days in the southern part of the state.
Summers in Alabama are among the hottest in the U.S., with high temperatures averaging over throughout the summer in some parts of the state. Alabama is also prone to </entity/>tropical-storm tropical-storms and even </entity/>hurricane hurricanes. Areas of the state far away from the Gulf are not immune to the effects of the storms, which often dump tremendous amounts of rain as they move inland and weaken.
South Alabama reports many </entity/>thunderstorms thunderstorms. The Gulf Coast, around Mobile Bay, averages between 70 and 80 days per year with thunder reported. This activity decreases somewhat further north in the state, but even the far north of the state reports thunder on about 60 days per year. Occasionally, thunderstorms are severe with frequent </entity/>lightning lightning and large </entity/>hail hail; the central and northern parts of the state are most vulnerable to this type of storm. Alabama ranks ninth in the number of deaths from lightning and tenth in the number of deaths from lightning strikes per capita.
Alabama, along with </entity/>Oklahoma Oklahoma, has the most reported </entity/>Enhanced-Fujita-scale </mention/>EF5-tornadoes of any state, according to statistics from the </entity/>National-Climatic-Data-Center National-Climatic-Data-Center for the period January 1, 1950, to June, 2013. Several long-tracked F5 tornadoes have contributed to Alabama reporting more tornado fatalities than any other state, even surpassing Texas which has a much larger area within </entity/>Tornado-Alley Tornado-Alley. The state suffered tremendous damage in the </entity/>Super-Outbreak Super-Outbreak of April 1974, and the </entity/>April-25–28,-2011-tornado-outbreak April-25–28,-2011-tornado-outbreak. The outbreak in April 2011 produced a record amount of tornadoes in the state. The tally reached 62.
</entity/>
The peak season for tornadoes varies from the northern to southern parts of the state. Alabama is one of the few places in the world that has a secondary tornado season in November and December, along with the spring severe weather season. The northern part of the state—along the Tennessee Valley—is one of the areas in the U.S. most vulnerable to violent tornadoes. The area of Alabama and Mississippi most affected by tornadoes is sometimes referred to as </entity/>Dixie-Alley Dixie-Alley, as distinct from the </entity/>Tornado-Alley Tornado-Alley of the Southern Plains.
Winters are generally mild in Alabama, as they are throughout most of the southeastern U.S., with average January low temperatures around in Mobile and around in Birmingham. Although snow is a rare event in much of Alabama, areas of the state north of Montgomery may receive a dusting of snow a few times every winter, with an occasional moderately heavy snowfall every few years. Historic snowfall events include </entity/>New-Year's-Eve-1963-snowstorm New-Year's-Eve-1963-snowstorm and the </entity/>1993-Storm-of-the-Century 1993-Storm-of-the-Century. The annual average snowfall for the Birmingham area is per year. In the southern Gulf coast, snowfall is less frequent, sometimes going several years without any snowfall.
Alabama's highest temperature of was recorded on September 5, 1925 in the unincorporated community of </entity/>Centerville,-Alabama </mention/>Centerville. The record low of occurred on January 30, 1966 in </entity/>New-Market,-Alabama </mention/>New-Market.
Flora and fauna.
</entity/>
Alabama is home to a diverse array of </entity/>flora flora and </entity/>fauna fauna, due largely to a variety of habitats that range from the </entity/>Tennessee-Valley Tennessee-Valley, </entity/>Appalachian-Plateau Appalachian-Plateau, and </entity/>Ridge-and-Valley-Appalachians Ridge-and-Valley-Appalachians of the north to the </entity/>Piedmont-(United-States) </mention/>Piedmont, </entity/>Canebrake-(region-of-Alabama) </mention/>Canebrake and </entity/>Black-Belt-(region-of-Alabama) </mention/>Black-Belt of the central region to the </entity/>Gulf-Coastal-Plain Gulf-Coastal-Plain and beaches along the </entity/>Gulf-of-Mexico Gulf-of-Mexico in the south. The state is usually ranked among the top in nation for its range of overall </entity/>biodiversity biodiversity.
Alabama once boasted huge expanses of pine forest, which still form the largest proportion of forests in the state. It currently ranks fifth in the nation for the diversity of its flora. It is home to nearly 4,000 </entity/>pteridophyte pteridophyte and </entity/>spermatophyte spermatophyte plant species.
</entity/>Indigenous-(ecology) </mention/>Indigenous animal species in the state include 62 </entity/>mammal mammal </entity/>species species, 93 </entity/>reptile reptile species, 73 </entity/>amphibian amphibian species, roughly 307 native </entity/>freshwater-fish freshwater-fish species, and 420 bird species that spend at least part of their year within the state. Invertebrates include 83 </entity/>crayfish crayfish species and 383 </entity/>mollusk mollusk species. 113 of these mollusk species have never been collected outside the state.
Demographics.
</entity/>
The </entity/>United-States-Census-Bureau United-States-Census-Bureau estimates that the population of Alabama was 4,833,722 on July 1, 2013, which represents an increase of 53,986, or 1.1%, since the </entity/>2010-United-States-Census </mention/>2010-Census. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 121,054 people (that is 502,457 births minus 381,403 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 104,991 people into the state.
</entity/>Immigration-to-the-United-States </mention/>Immigration from outside the U.S. resulted in a net increase of 31,180 people, and migration within the country produced a net gain of 73,811 people. The state had 108,000 foreign-born (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 22.2% were illegal immigrants (24,000).
The </entity/>center-of-population center-of-population of Alabama is located in </entity/>Chilton-County,-Alabama </mention/>Chilton-County, outside the town of </entity/>Jemison,-Alabama </mention/>Jemison.
Race and ancestry.
According to the </entity/>2010-United-States-Census </mention/>2010-Census, Alabama had a population of 4,779,736. The racial composition of the state was 68.5% White (67.0% Non-Hispanic </entity/>Non-Hispanic-Whites </mention/>White Alone), 26.2% </entity/>African-American </mention/>Black or African American, 3.9% </entity/>Hispanic-and-Latino-Americans </mention/>Hispanics or Latinos of any race, 1.1% Asian, 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 2.0% from Some Other Race, and 1.5% from Two or More Races. In 2011, 46.6% of Alabama's population younger than age 1 were minorities.
The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama are: African American (26.2%), </entity/>English-American </mention/>English (23.6%), </entity/>Irish-American </mention/>Irish (7.7%), </entity/>German-American </mention/>German (5.7%), and </entity/>Scots-Irish-American </mention/>Scots-Irish (2.0%). Those citing "American" ancestry in Alabama are generally of English or British ancestry; many </entity/>English-American </mention/>Anglo-Americans identify as having American ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in some cases since the 1600s. Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly English ancestry and that the figure is likely higher. In the 1980 census, 41% of the people in Alabama identified as being of English ancestry, making them the largest ethnic group at the time.
Based on historic migration and settlement patterns in the southern colonies and states, demographers estimated there are more people in Alabama of Scots-Irish origins than self-reported. Many people in Alabama claim Irish ancestry because of the term Scots-Irish but, based on historic immigration and settlement, their ancestors were more likely Protestant Scots-Irish coming from northern Ireland, where they had been for a few generations as part of the English colonization. The Scots-Irish were the largest non-English immigrant group from the British Isles before the American Revolution, and many settled in the South, later moving into the Deep South as it was developed.
In 1984, under the Davis–Strong Act, the state legislature established the </entity/>Alabama-Indian-Affairs-Commission Alabama-Indian-Affairs-Commission. Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given the long history of slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, have insisted on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black.
The state has </entity/>State-recognized-tribes-in-the-United-States </mention/>officially-recognized nine American Indian tribes in the state, descended mostly from the </entity/>Five-Civilized-Tribes Five-Civilized-Tribes of the American Southeast. These are:
The state government has promoted recognition of Native American contributions to the state, including the designation in 2000 for Columbus Day to be jointly celebrated as American Indian Heritage Day.

Alabama is located in the middle of the </entity/>Bible-Belt Bible-Belt, a region of numerous Protestant Christians. Alabama has been identified as one of the most religious states in the US, with about 58% of the population attending church regularly. A majority of people in the state identify as Evangelical Protestant. As of 2010, the three largest denominational groups in Alabama are the </entity/>Southern-Baptist-Convention Southern-Baptist-Convention, </entity/>The-United-Methodist-Church The-United-Methodist-Church, and non-denominational Evangelical Protestant.
In Alabama, the </entity/>Southern-Baptist-Convention Southern-Baptist-Convention has the highest number of adherents with 1,380,121; this is followed by the </entity/>United-Methodist-Church United-Methodist-Church with 327,734 adherents, non-denominational Evangelical Protestant with 220,938 adherents, and the Catholic Church with 150,647 adherents. Many Baptist and Methodist congregations became established in the </entity/>Great-Awakening Great-Awakening of the early 19th century, when preachers proselytized across the South. The </entity/>Assemblies-of-God Assemblies-of-God had almost 60,000 members, the </entity/>Churches-of-Christ Churches-of-Christ had nearly 120,000 members. The </entity/>Presbyterian-church Presbyterian-churches, strongly associated with Scots-Irish immigrants of the 18th century and their descendants, had a combined membership around 75,000 (</entity/>Presbyterian-Church-in-America </mention/>PCA-28,009 members in 108 congregations, </entity/>PC(USA) PC(USA)-26,247 members in 147 congregations, the </entity/>Cumberland-Presbyterian-Church Cumberland-Presbyterian-Church-6,000 members in 59 congregations, the </entity/>Cumberland-Presbyterian-Church-in-America Cumberland-Presbyterian-Church-in-America-5,000 members and 50 congreagtions plus the </entity/>Edgewater-Presbyterian-Church </mention/>EPC and Associate Reformed Presbyterians with 230 members and 9 congregations).
In a 2007 survey, nearly 70% of respondents could name all four of the Christian </entity/>Canonical-Gospels </mention/>Gospels. Of those who indicated a religious preference, 59% said they possessed a "full understanding" of their faith and needed no further learning. In a 2007 poll, 92% of Alabamians reported having at least some confidence in churches in the state.
Other faiths.
Although in much smaller numbers, many other religious faiths are represented in the state as well, including </entity/>Judaism Judaism, </entity/>Islam Islam, </entity/>Hinduism Hinduism, </entity/>Buddhism Buddhism, </entity/>Sikhism Sikhism, the </entity/>Bahá'í-Faith Bahá'í-Faith, and </entity/>Unitarian-Universalism Unitarian-Universalism.
Jews have been present in what is now Alabama since 1763, during the colonial era of Mobile, when </entity/>Sephardic-Jews Sephardic-Jews immigrated from London. The oldest Jewish congregation in the state is </entity/>Congregation-Sha'arai-Shomayim-(Mobile,-Alabama) </mention/>Congregation-Sha'arai-Shomayim in Mobile. It was formally recognized by the state legislature on January 25, 1844. Later immigrants in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries tended to be </entity/>Ashkenazy-Jews Ashkenazy-Jews from eastern Europe. Jewish denominations in the state include two </entity/>Orthodox-Judaism </mention/>Orthodox, four </entity/>Conservative-Judaism </mention/>Conservative, ten </entity/>Reform-Judaism-(North-America) </mention/>Reform, and one </entity/>Humanistic-Judaism </mention/>Humanistic synagogue.
Muslims have been increasing in Alabama, with 31 mosques built by 2011, many by African-American converts. Islam was a traditional religion in West Africa, from where many </entity/>Slavery-in-the-United-States </mention/>slaves were brought to the colonies and the United States during the centuries of the slave trade.
Several Hindu temples and cultural centers in the state have been founded by </entity/>Indian-people </mention/>Indian immigrants and their descendants, the most well-known being the Shri Swaminarayan Mandir in </entity/>Birmingham,-Alabama </mention/>Birmingham, the Hindu Temple and Cultural Center of Birmingham in </entity/>Pelham,-Alabama </mention/>Pelham, the Hindu Cultural Center of North Alabama in </entity/>Capshaw,-Alabama </mention/>Capshaw, and the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center in </entity/>Tuscaloosa,-Alabama </mention/>Tuscaloosa.
There are six </entity/>Dharma-centre </mention/>Dharma-centers and organizations for </entity/>Theravada Theravada </entity/>Buddhists Buddhists. Most monastic Buddhist temples are concentrated in southern Mobile County, near </entity/>Bayou-La-Batre,-Alabama </mention/>Bayou-La-Batre. This area has attracted an influx of refugees from </entity/>Cambodia Cambodia, Laos, and </entity/>South-Vietnam South-Vietnam during the 1970s and thereafter. The four temples within a ten-mile radius of Bayou La Batre, include Chua Chanh Giac, Wat Buddharaksa, and Wat Lao Phoutthavihan.
Health.
A </entity/>Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention Centers-for-Disease-Control-and-Prevention study in 2008 showed that obesity in Alabama was a problem, with most counties having over 29% of adults obese, except for ten which had a rate between 26% and 29%. Residents of the state, along with those in five other states, were least likely in the nation to be physically active during leisure time. Alabama, and the southeastern U.S. in general, has one of the highest incidences of adult onset </entity/>diabetes-type-II </mention/>diabetes in the country, exceeding 10% of adults.
Economy.
The state has invested in aerospace, education, health care, banking, and various heavy industries, including automobile manufacturing, mineral extraction, steel production and </entity/>fabrication-(metal) </mention/>fabrication. By 2006, crop and animal production in Alabama was valued at $1.5 billion. In contrast to the primarily agricultural economy of the previous century, this was only about 1% of the state's gross domestic product. The number of private farms has declined at a steady rate since the 1960s, as land has been sold to developers, timber companies, and large farming conglomerates.
Non-agricultural employment in 2008 was 121,800 in management occupations; 71,750 in business and financial operations; 36,790 in computer-related and mathematical occupation; 44,200 in architecture and engineering; 12,410 in life, physical, and social sciences; 32,260 in community and social services; 12,770 in legal occupations; 116,250 in education, training, and library services; 27,840 in art, design and media occupations; 121,110 in healthcare; 44,750 in fire fighting, law enforcement, and security; 154,040 in food preparation and serving; 76,650 in building and grounds cleaning and maintenance; 53,230 in personal care and services; 244,510 in sales; 338,760 in office and administration support; 20,510 in farming, fishing, and forestry; 120,155 in construction and mining, gas, and oil extraction; 106,280 in installation, maintenance, and repair; 224,110 in production; and 167,160 in transportation and material moving.
According to the U.S. </entity/>Bureau-of-Economic-Analysis Bureau-of-Economic-Analysis, the 2008 total </entity/>gross-state-product gross-state-product was $170 billion, or $29,411 per capita. Alabama's 2012 GDP increased 1.2% from the previous year. The single largest increase came in the area of information. In 2010, per capita income for the state was $22,984.
The state's seasonally adjusted unemployment rate was 6.4% in February 2014. This compared to a nationwide seasonally adjusted rate of 6.7%.

Law and government.
State government.
</entity/>
The foundational document for Alabama's government is the </entity/>Alabama-Constitution Alabama-Constitution, which was ratified in 1901. At almost 800 amendments and 310,000 words, it is by some accounts the world's longest constitution and is roughly forty times the length of the </entity/>United-States-Constitution United-States-Constitution. There has been a significant movement to rewrite and modernize Alabama's constitution.
Critics suggest that Alabama's constitution highly centralizes power in Montgomery and leaves practically no power in local hands. Any policy changes proposed around the state must be approved by the entire Alabama legislature and, frequently, by state referendum. One criticism of the current constitution claims that its complexity and length intentionally codify segregation and racism.
</entity/>
Alabama's government is divided into three coequal branches: The </entity/>legislative-branch legislative-branch is the </entity/>Alabama-Legislature Alabama-Legislature, a </entity/>bicameral bicameral assembly composed of the </entity/>Alabama-House-of-Representatives Alabama-House-of-Representatives, with 105 members, and the </entity/>Alabama-Senate Alabama-Senate, with 35 members. The Legislature is responsible for writing, debating, passing, or defeating state legislation. The </entity/>United-States-Republican-Party </mention/>Republican-Party currently holds a majority in both houses of the </entity/>Alabama-Legislature </mention/>Legislature. The Legislature has the power to override a gubernatorial veto by a simple majority (most state Legislatures require a two-thirds majority to override a veto).
The </entity/>executive-branch executive-branch is responsible for the execution and oversight of laws. It is headed by the </entity/>Governor-of-Alabama Governor-of-Alabama. Other members of executive branch include the cabinet, the </entity/>Attorney-General-of-Alabama Attorney-General-of-Alabama, the </entity/>Alabama-Secretary-of-State Alabama-Secretary-of-State, the </entity/>Alabama-State-Treasurer Alabama-State-Treasurer, and the </entity/>State-Auditor-of-Alabama State-Auditor-of-Alabama. The current </entity/>Governor-of-Alabama </mention/>governor of the state is </entity/>Republican-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Republican </entity/>Robert-J.-Bentley </mention/>Robert-Bentley. The </entity/>List-of-Lieutenant-Governors-of-Alabama </mention/>lieutenant-governor is Republican </entity/>Kay-Ivey Kay-Ivey.
The </entity/>Judiciary </mention/>judicial-branch is responsible for interpreting the </entity/>Alabama-Constitution </mention/>Constitution and applying the law in state criminal and civil cases. The </entity/>State-supreme-court </mention/>state's-highest-court is the </entity/>Supreme-Court-of-Alabama Supreme-Court-of-Alabama. Alabama uses partisan elections to choose judges, and since the 1980s judicial campaigns have become increasingly politicized. The current </entity/>chief-justice chief-justice of the Alabama Supreme Court is Republican </entity/>Roy-Moore Roy-Moore. All sitting justices on the Alabama Supreme Court are members of the Republican Party. There are two intermediate </entity/>appellate-court appellate-courts, the Court of Civil Appeals and the Court of Criminal Appeals, and four </entity/>trial-court trial-courts: the circuit court (which is the trial court of general jurisdiction), and the district, probate, and municipal courts).
The members of the Legislature take office immediately after the November elections. Statewide officials such as the governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, and other constitutional officers take office the following January.
Taxes.
Alabama levies a 2, 4, or 5 percent </entity/>State-income-tax </mention/>personal-income-tax, depending upon the amount earned and filing status. Taxpayers are allowed to deduct their </entity/>Income-tax-in-the-United-States </mention/>federal-income-tax from their Alabama state tax, and can do so even if taking the </entity/>standard-deduction standard-deduction. Taxpayers who file itemized deductions are also allowed to deduct the </entity/>Federal-Insurance-Contributions-Act-tax Federal-Insurance-Contributions-Act-tax (Social Security and Medicare tax).
The state's general sales tax rate is 4%. Sales tax rates for cities and counties are also added to purchases. For example, the total sales tax rate in Mobile is 10% and there is an additional restaurant tax of 1%, which means that a diner in Mobile would pay an 11% tax on a meal. , sales and excise taxes in Alabama account for 51% of all state and local revenue, compared with an average of about 36% nationwide. Alabama is one of seven states that levy a tax on food at the same rate as other goods, and one of two states (the other being neighboring Mississippi) which fully taxes groceries without any offsetting relief for low-income families. (Most states exempt groceries from sales tax, or have a lower rate for grocieries). 
Alabama's income tax on poor working families is among the highest in the United States. Alabama is the only state that levies income tax on a family of four with income as low as $4,600, which is barely one-quarter of the federal poverty line. Alabama's threshold is the lowest among the 41 states and the District of Columbia with income taxes.
The corporate income tax rate is currently 6.5%. The overall federal, state, and local tax burden in Alabama ranks the state as the second least tax-burdened state in the country. </entity/>Property-tax Property-taxes are the lowest in the U.S. The current state constitution requires a voter referendum to raise property taxes.
Since Alabama's tax structure largely depends on consumer spending, it is subject to high variable budget structure. For example, in 2003 Alabama had an annual budget deficit as high as $670 million.
Local and county government.
Alabama has 67 </entity/>county-(United-States) </mention/>counties. Each county has its own elected legislative branch, usually called the county commission, which normally also has executive authority in the county. Because of the restraints placed in the </entity/>Alabama-Constitution Alabama-Constitution, all but seven counties (Jefferson, Lee, Mobile, Madison, Montgomery, Shelby, and Tuscaloosa) in the state have little to no </entity/>home-rule home-rule. Instead, most counties in the state must lobby the Local Legislation Committee of the state legislature to get simple local policies such as waste disposal to land use zoning.
On November 9, 2011, Jefferson County, which was $4 billion in debt at the time, declared bankruptcy. This is the second-largest </entity/>Chapter-9,-Title-11,-United-States-Code </mention/>Chapter-9 (municipal) bankruptcy in the United States, after the </entity/>Detroit-bankruptcy Detroit-bankruptcy. Jefferson County emerged from bankruptcy in December 2013 following the approval of a bankruptcy plan by the </entity/>United-States-bankruptcy-court United-States-bankruptcy-court for the </entity/>United-States-District-Court-for-the-Northern-District-of-Alabama </mention/>Northern-District-of-Alabama.
Alabama is an </entity/>alcoholic-beverage-control-state alcoholic-beverage-control-state, meaning that the state government holds a monopoly on the sale of alcohol. The </entity/>Alabama-Alcoholic-Beverage-Control-Board Alabama-Alcoholic-Beverage-Control-Board controls the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages in the state. Twenty-five of the 67 counties are "</entity/>Dry-county </mention/>dry-counties" which ban the sale of alcohol, and there are many dry municipalities even in counties which permit alcohol sales.
Politics.
</entity/>
</entity/>
During </entity/>Reconstruction-era-of-the-United-States </mention/>Reconstruction following the </entity/>American-Civil-War American-Civil-War, Alabama was occupied by federal troops of the </entity/>Third-Military-District Third-Military-District under </entity/>John-Pope-(military-officer) </mention/>General-John-Pope. In 1874, the political coalition known as the </entity/>Redeemers Redeemers took control of the state government from the Republicans, in part by suppressing the African American vote.
After 1890, a coalition of White politicians passed laws to </entity/>racial-segregation </mention/>segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disfranchised African Americans also disfranchised poor Whites, however. By 1941 more Whites than African Americans had been disfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000, although the impact was greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal treatment under the law.
From 1901 through the 1960s, the state did not redraw election districts as population grew and shifted within the state. The result was a rural minority that dominated state politics until a series of court cases required redistricting in 1972.
Alabama state politics gained nationwide and international attention in the 1950s and 1960s during the </entity/>African-American-Civil-Rights-Movement-(1955–1968) </mention/>American-Civil-Rights-Movement, when racist Whites bureaucratically, and at times, violently resisted protests for electoral and social reform. Democrat </entity/>George-Wallace George-Wallace, the state's only four-term governor, was a controversial figure. Only with the passage of the Federal </entity/>Civil-Rights-Act-of-1964 Civil-Rights-Act-of-1964 and </entity/>Voting-Rights-Act Voting-Rights-Act of 1965 did African Americans regain suffrage, among other civil rights.
In 2007, the </entity/>Alabama-Legislature Alabama-Legislature passed, and Republican Governor </entity/>Bob-Riley Bob-Riley signed a resolution expressing "profound regret" over slavery and its lingering impact. In a symbolic ceremony, the bill was signed in the </entity/>Alabama-State-Capitol Alabama-State-Capitol, which housed Congress of the </entity/>Confederate-States-of-America Confederate-States-of-America.
In 2010, Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in 136 years.
Elections.
State elections.
With the disfranchisement of African Americans, the state became part of the "</entity/>Solid-South Solid-South", a system in which the </entity/>Democratic-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Democratic-Party became essentially the only political party in every Southern state. For nearly 100 years, local and state elections in Alabama were decided in the Democratic Party </entity/>primary-election </mention/>primary, with generally only token </entity/>United-States-Republican-Party </mention/>Republican challengers running in the General Election.
Republicans hold all nine seats on the </entity/>Alabama-Supreme-Court Alabama-Supreme-Court and all ten seats on the state appellate courts. Until 1994, no Republicans held any of the court seats. This change also began, likely in part, due to the same perception by voters of Democratic party efforts to disenfranchise voters again in 1994. In that general election, the then-incumbent Chief Justice of Alabama, </entity/>Ernest-C.-Hornsby Ernest-C.-Hornsby, refused to leave office after losing the election by approximately 3,000 votes to Republican </entity/>Perry-O.-Hooper,-Sr. Perry-O.-Hooper,-Sr.. Hornsby sued Alabama and defiantly remained in office for nearly a year before finally giving up the seat after losing in court. This ultimately led to a collapse of support for Democrats at the ballot box in the next three or four election cycles. The Democrats lost the last of the nineteen court seats in August 2011 with the resignation of the last Democrat on the bench.
Republicans hold all seven of the </entity/>Political-party-strength-in-Alabama </mention/>statewide-elected-executive branch offices. Republicans hold six of the eight elected seats on the </entity/>Alabama-State-Board-of-Education Alabama-State-Board-of-Education. In 2010, Republicans took large majorities of both chambers of the state legislature giving them control of that body for the first time in 136 years. Democrats hold one of the three seats on the Alabama Public Service Commission.
Only two Republican Lieutenant Governors have been elected since Reconstruction, one is </entity/>Kay-Ivey Kay-Ivey, the current Lieutenant Governor.
Local elections.
Many local offices (County Commissioners, Boards of Education, Tax Assessors, Tax Collectors, etc.) in the state are still held by Democrats. Local elections in most rural counties are generally decided in the Democratic primary and local elections in metropolitan and suburban counties are generally decided in the Republican Primary, although there are exceptions.
Alabama's 67 County Sheriffs are elected in partisan races and Democrats still retain the majority of those posts. The current split is 42 </entity/>Alabama-Democratic-Party </mention/>Democrats, 24 </entity/>Alabama-Republican-Party </mention/>Republicans, and one Independent (Choctaw). However, most of the Democratic sheriffs preside over rural and less populated counties and the majority of Republican sheriffs preside over more urban/suburban and heavily populated counties. Two Alabama counties (Montgomery and Calhoun) with a population of over 100,000 have Democratic sheriffs and five </entity/>Counties-of-Alabama </mention/>Alabama-counties with a population of under 75,000 have Republican sheriffs (Autauga, Coffee, Dale, Coosa, and Blount). As of 2012, the state of Alabama has one female sheriff, in </entity/>Morgan-County,-Alabama Morgan-County,-Alabama, and nine African American sheriffs.
Federal elections.
The state's two </entity/>United-States-Senate </mention/>U.S.-senators are </entity/>Jeff-Sessions </mention/>Jefferson-B.-Sessions-III and </entity/>Richard-Shelby </mention/>Richard-C.-Shelby, both Republicans. Shelby was originally elected to the Senate as a Democrat in 1986 and re-elected in 1992, but switched parties in November 1994.
In the </entity/>U.S.-House-of-Representatives U.S.-House-of-Representatives, the state is represented by seven members, six of whom are Republicans: (</entity/>Jo-Bonner Jo-Bonner, </entity/>Mike-D.-Rogers Mike-D.-Rogers, </entity/>Robert-Aderholt Robert-Aderholt, </entity/>Morris-J.-Brooks Morris-J.-Brooks, </entity/>Martha-Roby Martha-Roby, and </entity/>Spencer-Bachus Spencer-Bachus) and one Democrat: </entity/>Terri-Sewell Terri-Sewell.
Education.
Primary and secondary education.
</entity/>
Public primary and secondary education in Alabama is under the purview of the </entity/>Alabama-State-Board-of-Education Alabama-State-Board-of-Education as well as local oversight by 67 county school boards and 60 city boards of education. Together, 1,496 individual schools provide education for 744,637 elementary and secondary students.
Public school funding is appropriated through the Alabama Legislature through the Education Trust Fund. In FY 2006–2007, Alabama appropriated $3,775,163,578 for primary and secondary education. That represented an increase of $444,736,387 over the previous fiscal year. In 2007, over 82 percent of schools made adequate yearly progress (AYP) toward student proficiency under the National </entity/>No-Child-Left-Behind No-Child-Left-Behind law, using measures determined by the state of Alabama.
While Alabama's public education system has improved in recent decades, it lags behind in achievement compared to other states. According to U.S. Census data, Alabama's high school graduation rate—75%—is the fourth lowest in the U.S. (after Kentucky, Louisiana and Mississippi). The largest educational gains were among people with some college education but without degrees.
Colleges and universities.
</entity/>
Alabama's programs of higher education include 14 four-year public universities, two-year community colleges, and 17 private, undergraduate and graduate universities. In the state are three medical schools (</entity/>University-of-Alabama-School-of-Medicine University-of-Alabama-School-of-Medicine, </entity/>University-of-South-Alabama University-of-South-Alabama and </entity/>Alabama-College-of-Osteopathic-Medicine Alabama-College-of-Osteopathic-Medicine), two veterinary colleges (</entity/>Auburn-University Auburn-University and </entity/>Tuskegee-University Tuskegee-University), a dental school (</entity/>University-of-Alabama-School-of-Dentistry University-of-Alabama-School-of-Dentistry), an optometry college (</entity/>University-of-Alabama-at-Birmingham University-of-Alabama-at-Birmingham), two pharmacy schools (</entity/>Auburn-University Auburn-University and </entity/>Samford-University Samford-University), and five law schools (</entity/>University-of-Alabama-School-of-Law University-of-Alabama-School-of-Law, </entity/>Birmingham-School-of-Law Birmingham-School-of-Law, </entity/>Cumberland-School-of-Law Cumberland-School-of-Law, </entity/>Miles-Law-School Miles-Law-School, and the </entity/>Thomas-Goode-Jones-School-of-Law Thomas-Goode-Jones-School-of-Law). Public, post-secondary education in Alabama is overseen by the </entity/>Alabama-Commission-on-Higher-Education Alabama-Commission-on-Higher-Education and the </entity/>Alabama-Department-of-Postsecondary-Education Alabama-Department-of-Postsecondary-Education.

Achilles

</entity/>
</entity/>
In </entity/>Greek-mythology Greek-mythology, Achilles (; , "Akhilleus", ) was a </entity/>Greeks </mention/>Greek hero of the </entity/>Trojan-War Trojan-War and the central character and greatest warrior of </entity/>Homer Homer's "</entity/>Iliad Iliad". His mother was the nymph </entity/>Thetis Thetis, and his father, </entity/>Peleus Peleus, was the king of the </entity/>Myrmidons Myrmidons.
Achilles’ most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan hero </entity/>Hector Hector outside the gates of </entity/>Troy Troy. Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the "Iliad", other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by </entity/>Paris-(mythology) </mention/>Paris, who shot him in the heel with an arrow. Later legends (beginning with a poem by </entity/>Statius Statius in the 1st century AD) state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for his heel. Because of his death from a small wound in the heel, the term "</entity/>Achilles'-heel Achilles'-heel" has come to mean a person's point of weakness.
Etymology.
Achilles' name can be analyzed as a combination of ("akhos") "grief" and ("laos") "a people, tribe, nation." In other words, Achilles is an embodiment of the grief of the people, grief being a theme raised numerous times in the "Iliad" (frequently by Achilles). Achilles' role as the hero of grief forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of Achilles as the hero of κλέος "kleos" ("glory", usually glory in war).
"Laos" has been construed by </entity/>Gregory-Nagy Gregory-Nagy, following Leonard Palmer, to mean "a corps of soldiers", a </entity/>muster-(military) </mention/>muster. With this derivation, the name would have a double meaning in the poem: When the hero is functioning rightly, his men bring grief to the enemy, but when wrongly, his men get the grief of war. The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership.
</entity/>Robert-S.-P.-Beekes </mention/>R.-S.-P.-Beekes has suggested a </entity/>Pre-Greek Pre-Greek origin of the name.
The name Achilleus was a common and attested name among the Greeks soon after the 7th century BC. It was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία ("Achilleía") attested in Attica in the 4th century BC (</entity/>Inscriptiones-Graecae </mention/>IG II² 1617) and, in the form "Achillia", on a </entity/>Female-gladiator#Halicarnassus </mention/>stele-in-Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an "Amazon".
Birth.
</entity/>
Achilles was the son of the </entity/>Nereid Nereid </entity/>Thetis Thetis and </entity/>Peleus Peleus, the king of the </entity/>Myrmidons Myrmidons. </entity/>Zeus Zeus and </entity/>Poseidon Poseidon had been rivals for the hand of Thetis until </entity/>Prometheus Prometheus, the fore-thinker, warned Zeus of a prophecy that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father. For this reason, the two gods withdrew their pursuit, and had her wed Peleus.
There is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events: in "</entity/>Argonautica Argonautica" (iv.760) Zeus' sister and wife </entity/>Hera Hera alludes to Thetis' chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus, that Thetis was so loyal to Hera's marriage bond that she coolly rejected him. Thetis, although a daughter of the sea-god </entity/>Nereus Nereus, was also brought up by Hera, further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus.
</entity/>
According to the "</entity/>Achilleid Achilleid", written by </entity/>Statius Statius in the 1st century AD, and to no surviving previous sources, when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal, by dipping him in the river </entity/>Styx Styx. However, he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him, his heel (see </entity/>Achilles-heel Achilles-heel, </entity/>Achilles'-tendon Achilles'-tendon). It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier. In another version of this story, Thetis anointed the boy in </entity/>ambrosia ambrosia and put him on top of a fire, to burn away the mortal parts of his body. She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage.
However, none of the sources before Statius makes any reference to this general invulnerability. To the contrary, in the "Iliad" Homer mentions Achilles being wounded: in Book 21 the </entity/>Paeonian Paeonian hero </entity/>Asteropaeus Asteropaeus, son of Pelagon, challenged Achilles by the river Scamander. He cast two spears at once, one grazed Achilles' elbow, "drawing a spurt of blood".
Also, in the fragmentary poems of the </entity/>Epic-Cycle Epic-Cycle in which we can find description of the hero's death, "</entity/>Cypria Cypria" (unknown author), "</entity/>Aithiopis Aithiopis" by </entity/>Arctinus-of-Miletus Arctinus-of-Miletus, "</entity/>Little-Iliad Little-Iliad" by Lesche of Mytilene, "</entity/>Iliou-persis Iliou-persis" by </entity/>Arctinus-of-Miletus Arctinus-of-Miletus, there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness (heel); in the later vase paintings presenting Achilles' death, the arrow (or in many cases, arrows) hit his body.
Peleus entrusted Achilles to </entity/>Chiron Chiron the </entity/>Centaur Centaur, on Mt. </entity/>Pelion Pelion, to be reared.
Achilles in the Trojan War.
</entity/>
The first two lines of the "Iliad" read:
Achilles' consuming rage is at times wavering, but at other times he cannot be cooled. The humanization of Achilles by the events of the war is an important theme of the narrative.
According to the "Iliad", Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships, each carrying 50 </entity/>Myrmidons Myrmidons (Book 2). He appointed five leaders (each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons): Menesthius, Eudorus, Peisander, Phoenix and Alcimedon (Book 16).
Telephus.
When the Greeks left for the Trojan War, they accidentally stopped in </entity/>Mysia Mysia, ruled by King </entity/>Telephus Telephus. In the resulting battle, Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal; Telephus consulted an oracle, who stated that "he that wounded shall heal". Guided by the oracle, he arrived at </entity/>Argos Argos, where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy. 
According to other reports in </entity/>Euripides Euripides' lost play about Telephus, he went to </entity/>Aulis-(ancient-Greece) </mention/>Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound. Achilles refused, claiming to have no medical knowledge. Alternatively, Telephus held </entity/>Orestes-(mythology) </mention/>Orestes for ransom, the ransom being Achilles' aid in healing the wound. </entity/>Odysseus Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound; therefore, the spear must be able to heal it. Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed. 
Troilus.
According to the "</entity/>Cypria Cypria" (the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles' Wrath), when the </entity/>Achaeans-(Homer) </mention/>Achaeans desired to return home, they were restrained by Achilles, who afterwards attacked the cattle of </entity/>Aeneas Aeneas, sacked neighboring cities and killed </entity/>Troilus Troilus.
In </entity/>Dares-Phrygius Dares-Phrygius' "Account of the Destruction of Troy", the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe, </entity/>Troilus Troilus was a young Trojan prince, the youngest of King </entity/>Priam Priam's (or sometimes </entity/>Apollo Apollo) and </entity/>Hecuba Hecuba's five legitimate sons. Despite his youth, he was one of the main Trojan war leaders. Prophecies linked Troilus' fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him. Yet Achilles, struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister </entity/>Polyxena Polyxena, and overcome with lust, directed his sexual attentions on the youth – who refusing to yield found instead himself decapitated upon an altar-omphalos of Apollo. Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an over-ardent lovers' embrace. In this version of the myth, Achilles' death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege. Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents. Had Troilus lived to adulthood, the </entity/>First-Vatican-Mythographer First-Vatican-Mythographer claimed, Troy would have been invincible.
Achilles in the "Iliad".
</entity/>
Homer's "Iliad" is the most famous narrative of Achilles' deeds in the Trojan War. Achilles' wrath is the central theme of the poem. The Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the war, and does not narrate Achilles' death. It begins with Achilles' withdrawal from battle after he is dishonored by </entity/>Agamemnon Agamemnon, the commander of the </entity/>Achaeans-(Homer) </mention/>Achaean forces. Agamemnon had taken a woman named </entity/>Chryseis Chryseis as his slave. Her father </entity/>Chryses Chryses, a priest of </entity/>Apollo Apollo, begs Agamemnon to return her to him. Agamemnon refuses and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks. The prophet </entity/>Calchas Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him. Achilles does so and Calchas declares Chryseis must be returned to her father. Agamemnon consents, but then commands that Achilles' battle prize </entity/>Briseis Briseis be brought to him to replace Chryseis. Angry at the dishonor of having his plunder and glory taken away (and as he says later, because he loved Briseis), with the urging of his mother Thetis, Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces. At this same time, burning with rage over Agamemnon's theft, Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war, so that he may regain his honor.
As the battle turns against the Greeks, thanks to the influence of Zeus, </entity/>Nestor-(mythology) </mention/>Nestor declares that the Trojans are winning because Agamemnon has angered Achilles, and urges the king to appease the warrior. Agamemnon agrees and sent </entity/>Odysseus Odysseus and two other chieftains, </entity/>Ajax-(mythology) </mention/>Ajax and </entity/>Phoenix-(son-of-Amyntor) </mention/>Phoenix, to Achilles with the offer of the return of Briseis and other gifts. Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him, and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do.
The Trojans, led by </entity/>Hector Hector, subsequently pushed the Greek army back toward the beaches and assaulted the Greek ships. With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction, </entity/>Patroclus Patroclus leads the </entity/>Myrmidons Myrmidons into battle wearing Achilles' armor, though Achilles remains at his camp. Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches, but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy.
</entity/>
After receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from </entity/>Antilochus Antilochus, the son of Nestor, Achilles grieves over his beloved companion's death and holds many funeral games in his honor. His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles. She persuades </entity/>Hephaestus Hephaestus to make new armor for him, in place of the armor that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector. The new armor includes the </entity/>Shield-of-Achilles Shield-of-Achilles, described in great detail in the poem.
Enraged over the death of Patroclus, Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector. Achilles even engages in battle with the river god </entity/>Scamander Scamander who becomes angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed. The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by </entity/>Hera Hera and Hephaestus. Zeus himself takes note of Achilles' rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction, seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself. Finally, Achilles finds his prey. Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before </entity/>Athena Athena, in the form of Hector's favorite and dearest brother, </entity/>Deiphobus Deiphobus, persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face. After Hector realizes the trick, he knows the battle is inevitable. Wanting to go down fighting, he charges at Achilles with his only weapon, his sword, but misses. Accepting his fate, Hector begs Achilles, not to spare his life, but to treat his body with respect after killing him. Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him, declaring that "my rage, my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have caused me". Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot during Patroclus' funeral games.
With the assistance of the god </entity/>Hermes Hermes, Hector's father, </entity/>Priam Priam, goes to Achilles' tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hector's body so that he can be buried. Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral. The poem ends with a description of Hector's funeral, with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come.
Penthesilea.
Achilles, after his temporary truce with Priam, fought and killed the </entity/>Amazons </mention/>Amazonian warrior queen </entity/>Penthesilea Penthesilea, but later grieved over her death. At first, he was so distracted by her beauty, he did not fight as intensely as usual. Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life, he refocused and killed her.
Memnon, and the fall of Achilles.
</entity/>
Following the death of Patroclus, Achilles' closest companion was Nestor's son </entity/>Antilochus Antilochus. When </entity/>Memnon-(mythology) </mention/>Memnon, king of </entity/>Ethiopia-(mythology) </mention/>Ethiopia slew Antilochus, Achilles once more obtained revenge on the battlefield, killing Memnon. The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus, except that Memnon (unlike Hector) was also the son of a goddess.
Many Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the "Iliad"'s description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles' reaction to it. The episode then formed the basis of the </entity/>Epic-Cycle </mention/>cyclic-epic "</entity/>Aethiopis Aethiopis", which was composed after the "Iliad", possibly in the 7th century B.C. The "Aethiopis" is now lost, except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors.
The death of Achilles, as predicted by </entity/>Hector Hector with his dying breath, was brought about by </entity/>Paris-(mythology) </mention/>Paris with an arrow (to the heel according to Statius). In some versions, the god </entity/>Apollo Apollo guided Paris' arrow. Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow.
</entity/>
All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valor, owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was, and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield. His bones were mingled with those of </entity/>Patroclus Patroclus, and funeral games were held. He was represented in the "Aethiopis" as living after his death in the island of </entity/>Leuke Leuke at the mouth of the river </entity/>Danube Danube.
Another version of Achilles' death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses, </entity/>Polyxena Polyxena. Achilles asks Priam for Polyxena's hand in marriage. Priam is willing because it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the world's greatest warrior. But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles, Paris, who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister, hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow, killing him.
Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus.
Paris was later killed by </entity/>Philoctetes Philoctetes using the enormous bow of </entity/>Heracles Heracles.
Fate of Achilles' armor.
Achilles' armor was the object of a feud between </entity/>Odysseus Odysseus and </entity/>Ajax-(mythology) </mention/>Telamonian-Ajax (Ajax the greater). They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners, who after considering both men came to a consensus in favor of Odysseus. Furious, Ajax cursed Odysseus, which earned the ire of Athena. Athena temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep, thinking them his comrades. After a while, when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep, Ajax was left so ashamed that he committed suicide. Odysseus eventually gave the armor to </entity/>Neoptolemus Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles.
A relic claimed to be Achilles' bronze-headed spear was for centuries preserved in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of </entity/>Phaselis Phaselis, Lycia, a port on the Pamphylian Gulf. The city was visited in 333 BC by </entity/>Alexander-the-Great Alexander-the-Great, who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the "Iliad" with him, but his court biographers do not mention the spear. But it was being shown in the time of </entity/>Pausanias-(geographer) </mention/>Pausanias in the 2nd century AD.
Achilles and Patroclus.
The exact nature of Achilles' relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times. In the "Iliad", it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship. </entity/>Homer Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus were lovers. Despite there being no direct evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers, this theory was expressed by some later authors. Commentators from </entity/>classical-antiquity classical-antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures. In 5th-century BC Athens, the intense bond was often viewed in light of the </entity/>Pederasty-in-ancient-Greece </mention/>Greek-custom-of-"paiderasteia". In Plato's "Symposium", the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple; Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover. But ancient Greek had no words to distinguish </entity/>heterosexual heterosexual and homosexual, and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women.
Worship of Achilles in antiquity.
</entity/>
There was an archaic </entity/>heroic-cult heroic-cult of Achilles on the </entity/>Snake-Island-(Black-Sea) </mention/>White-Island,-"Leuce", in the </entity/>Black-Sea Black-Sea off the modern coasts of </entity/>Romania Romania and </entity/>Ukraine Ukraine, with a temple and an </entity/>oracle oracle which survived into the Roman period.
In the lost epic " </entity/>Aithiopis Aithiopis", a continuation of the "Iliad" attributed to </entity/>Arctinus </mention/>Arktinus-of-Miletos, Achilles’ mother Thetis returned to mourn him and removed his ashes from the pyre and took them to Leuce at the mouths of the Danube. There the Achaeans raised a </entity/>tumulus tumulus for him and celebrated funeral games.
</entity/>Pliny-the-Elder </mention/>Pliny's "</entity/>Natural-History-(Pliny) </mention/>Natural-History" mentions a tumulus that is no longer evident ("Insula Akchillis tumulo eius viri clara"), on the island consecrated to him, located at a distance of fifty Roman miles from </entity/>Peuce Peuce by the </entity/>Danube-Delta Danube-Delta, and the temple there. </entity/>Pausanias-(geographer) </mention/>Pausanias has been told that the island is "covered with forests and full of animals, some wild, some tame. In this island there is also Achilles’ temple and his statue". Ruins of a square temple 30 meters to a side, possibly that dedicated to Achilles, were discovered by Captain Kritzikly in 1823, but there has been no modern archeological work done on the island.
</entity/>Pomponius-Mela Pomponius-Mela tells that Achilles is buried in the island named Achillea, between Boristhene and Ister. The Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetus of Bithynia, who lived at the time of Domitian, writes that the island was called "Leuce" "because the wild animals which live there are white. It is said that there, in Leuce island, reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes, and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island; this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues, because through virtue they had acquired everlasting honor".
The "</entity/>Periplus-Ponti-Euxini </mention/>Periplus-of-the-Euxine-Sea" gives the following details: "It is said that the goddess Thetis raised this island from the sea, for her son Achilles, who dwells there. Here is his temple and his statue, an archaic work. This island is not inhabited, and goats graze on it, not many, which the people who happen to arrive here with their ships, sacrifice to Achilles. In this temple are also deposited a great many holy gifts, craters, rings and precious stones, offered to Achilles in gratitude. One can still read inscriptions in Greek and Latin, in which Achilles is praised and celebrated. Some of these are worded in Patroclus’ honor, because those who wish to be favored by Achilles, honor Patroclus at the same time. There are also in this island countless numbers of sea birds, which look after Achilles’ temple. Every morning they fly out to sea, wet their wings with water, and return quickly to the temple and sprinkle it. And after they finish the sprinkling, they clean the hearth of the temple with their wings. Other people say still more, that some of the men who reach this island, come here intentionally. They bring animals in their ships, destined to be sacrificed. Some of these animals they slaughter, others they set free on the island, in Achilles’ honor. But there are others, who are forced to come to this island by sea storms. As they have no sacrificial animals, but wish to get them from the god of the island himself, they consult Achilles’ oracle. They ask permission to slaughter the victims chosen from among the animals that graze freely on the island, and to deposit in exchange the price which they consider fair. But in case the oracle denies them permission, because there is an oracle here, they add something to the price offered, and if the oracle refuses again, they add something more, until at last, the oracle agrees that the price is sufficient. And then the victim doesn’t run away any more, but waits willingly to be caught. So, there is a great quantity of silver there, consecrated to the hero, as price for the sacrificial victims. To some of the people who come to this island, Achilles appears in dreams, to others he would appear even during their navigation, if they were not too far away, and would instruct them as to which part of the island they would better anchor their ships". (quoted in Densuşianu)
The heroic cult of Achilles on Leuce island was widespread in antiquity, not only along the sea lanes of the </entity/>Black-Sea </mention/>Pontic-Sea but also in maritime cities whose economic interests were tightly connected to the riches of the Black Sea.
Achilles from Leuce island was venerated as "Pontarches" the lord and master of the Pontic Sea, the protector of sailors and navigation. Sailors went out of their way to offer sacrifice. To Achilles of Leuce were dedicated a number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters: Achilleion in Messenia (</entity/>Stephanus-Byzantinus Stephanus-Byzantinus), Achilleios in Laconia (</entity/>Pausanias-(geographer) </mention/>Pausanias, III.25,4) </entity/>Nicolae-Densuşianu Nicolae-Densuşianu (Densuşianu 1913) even though he recognized Achilles in the name of </entity/>Aquileia Aquileia and in the north arm of the Danube delta, the arm of Chilia ("Achileii"), though his conclusion, that Leuce had sovereign rights over Pontos, evokes modern rather than archaic sea-law."
Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing. Pausanias (III.19,13) reports that the </entity/>Delphi </mention/>Delphic-Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound. </entity/>Ammianus-Marcellinus Ammianus-Marcellinus (XXII.8) attributes the healing to waters ("aquae") on the island.
Worship of Achilles in modern times: The Achilleion in Corfu.
In the region of Gastouri (Γαστούρι) to the south of the city of </entity/>Corfu Corfu Greece, Empress of Austria </entity/>Elisabeth-of-Bavaria Elisabeth-of-Bavaria also known as Sissi built in 1890 a summer palace with Achilles as its central theme and it is a monument to </entity/>platonism </mention/>platonic </entity/>romanticism romanticism. The palace, naturally, was named after Achilles: "</entity/>Achilleion-(Corfu) </mention/>Achilleion" (Αχίλλειον). This elegant structure abounds with paintings and statues of Achilles both in the main hall and in the lavish gardens depicting the heroic and tragic scenes of the </entity/>Trojan-war Trojan-war.
Other stories.
</entity/>
Some post-Homeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war, Thetis (or, in some versions, Peleus) hides the young man at the court of </entity/>Lycomedes Lycomedes, king of </entity/>Skyros Skyros. There, Achilles is disguised as a girl and lives among Lycomedes' daughters, perhaps under the name "Pyrrha" (the red-haired girl). With Lycomedes' daughter </entity/>Deidamia-(mythology) </mention/>Deidamia, whom in the account of Statius he rapes, Achilles there fathers a son, </entity/>Neoptolemus Neoptolemus (also called Pyrrhus, after his father's possible alias). According to this story, Odysseus learns from the prophet </entity/>Calchas Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles' aid. Odysseus goes to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling women's clothes and jewelry and places a shield and spear among his goods. When Achilles instantly takes up the spear, Odysseus sees through his disguise and convinces him to join the Greek campaign. In another version of the story, Odysseus arranges for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes' women; while the women flee in panic, Achilles prepares to defend the court, thus giving his identity away.
In book 11 of Homer's "</entity/>Odyssey Odyssey", Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades. One of these is Achilles, who when greeted as "blessed in life, blessed in death", responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead. But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his son's exploits in the Trojan war, and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus' heroic actions, Achilles is filled with satisfaction. This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life. Achilles was worshipped as a sea-god in many of the </entity/>Greek-colonies Greek-colonies on the Black Sea, the location of the mythical "White Island" which he was said to inhabit after his death, together with many other heroes.
The kings of the </entity/>Despotate-of-Epirus </mention/>Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son, Neoptolemus. </entity/>Alexander-the-Great Alexander-the-Great, son of the Epirote princess </entity/>Olympias Olympias, could therefore also claim this descent, and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor. He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at </entity/>Achilleion-(Troad)#Tomb-of-Achilles </mention/>Achilleion while passing Troy. In AD 216 the Roman Emperor </entity/>Caracalla Caracalla, while on his way to war against </entity/>Parthia Parthia, emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles' tumulus.
Achilles fought and killed the </entity/>Amazons </mention/>Amazon </entity/>Helene-(Amazon) </mention/>Helene. Some also said he married </entity/>Medea Medea, and that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades – as Hera promised Thetis in </entity/>Apollonius-of-Rhodes </mention/>Apollonius' "</entity/>Argonautica Argonautica". In some versions of the myth, Achilles has a relationship with his captive </entity/>Briseis Briseis.
Achilles in Greek tragedy.
The </entity/>tragedy </mention/>Greek-tragedian </entity/>Aeschylus Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles, given the title "Achilleis" by modern scholars. The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War, including his defeat of </entity/>Hector Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by </entity/>Paris-(mythology) </mention/>Paris and guided by </entity/>Apollo Apollo punctures his heel. Extant fragments of the "Achilleis" and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play. The first part of the "Achilleis" trilogy, "The Myrmidons", focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus, who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon; only a few lines survive today. In Plato's "Symposium", Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved; Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect because Achilles, being the younger and more beautiful of the two, was the beloved, who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to revenge him.
The tragedian </entity/>Sophocles Sophocles also wrote "The Lovers of Achilles", a play with Achilles as the main character. Only a few fragments survive.
Towards the end of the 5th century BC, a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama; Euripides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in "</entity/>Hecuba-(play) </mention/>Hecuba", "</entity/>Electra-(Euripides) </mention/>Electra", and "</entity/>Iphigenia-in-Aulis Iphigenia-in-Aulis".
Achilles in Greek philosophy.
The philosopher </entity/>Zeno-of-Elea Zeno-of-Elea centered one of </entity/>Zeno's-paradoxes </mention/>his-paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between "</entity/>Epithets-in-Homer#Individuals </mention/>swift-footed" </entity/>Zeno's-paradoxes#Achilles-and-the-tortoise </mention/>Achilles-and-a-tortoise, by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start, and therefore that motion and change were impossible. As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school, Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions.
Achilles in Roman and medieval literature.
The Romans, who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy, took a highly negative view of Achilles. </entity/>Vergil Vergil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men, while </entity/>Horace Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children. Other writers, such as </entity/>Catullus Catullus, </entity/>Propertius Propertius, and </entity/>Ovid Ovid, represent a second strand of disparagement, with an emphasis on Achilles' erotic career. This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as </entity/>Dictys-Cretensis Dictys-Cretensis and </entity/>Dares-Phrygius Dares-Phrygius and in </entity/>Benoît-de-Sainte-Maure Benoît-de-Sainte-Maure's "</entity/>Roman-de-Troie Roman-de-Troie" and </entity/>Guido-delle-Colonne Guido-delle-Colonne's "</entity/>Historia-destructionis-Troiae Historia-destructionis-Troiae", which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the </entity/>Matter-of-Troy Matter-of-Troy until the 17th century.

Abraham Lincoln

Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was the </entity/>List-of-Presidents-of-the-United-States </mention/>16th-president-of-the-United-States, serving from March 1861 until </entity/>Assassination-of-Abraham-Lincoln </mention/>his-assassination-in-April-1865. Lincoln led the United States through its </entity/>American-Civil-War </mention/>Civil-War—its bloodiest war and its greatest moral, constitutional and political crisis. In doing so, he preserved the </entity/>Union-(American-Civil-War) </mention/>Union, abolished slavery, strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy.
Reared in a poor family on the </entity/>American-frontier </mention/>western-frontier, Lincoln was a self-educated lawyer in </entity/>Illinois Illinois, a </entity/>Whig-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Whig-Party-leader, </entity/>Illinois-House-of-Representatives </mention/>state-legislator during the 1830s, and a one-term member of the Congress during the 1840s. He promoted rapid modernization of the economy through banks, canals, railroads and tariffs to encourage the building of factories; he opposed the war with Mexico in 1846. After a </entity/>Lincoln–Douglas-debates </mention/>series-of-highly-publicized-debates in 1858, during which Lincoln spoke out against the expansion of slavery, he lost the U.S. Senate race to his archrival, Democrat </entity/>Stephen-A.-Douglas Stephen-A.-Douglas.
Lincoln, a moderate from a swing state, secured the </entity/>History-of-the-Republican-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Republican-Party presidential nomination in 1860. With very little support in the slave states, Lincoln swept the North and was </entity/>United-States-presidential-election,-1860 </mention/>elected-president-in-1860. His election prompted seven southern slave states to form the </entity/>Confederate-States-of-America </mention/>Confederacy before he took the office. No compromise or reconciliation was found regarding slavery.
When the North enthusiastically rallied behind the </entity/>Union-(American-Civil-War) </mention/>Union after the Confederate attack on </entity/>Fort-Sumter Fort-Sumter on April 12, 1861, Lincoln concentrated on the military and political dimensions of the war effort. His primary goal was to reunite the nation. He unilaterally suspended </entity/>habeas-corpus habeas-corpus, arresting and temporarily detaining thousands holding secessionist or anti-war views in the border states without trial, ignoring the </entity/>Ex-parte-Merryman </mention/>ruling by </entity/>Roger-Taney </mention/>U.S.-Supreme-Court-Chief-Justice that such suspension was unconstitutional (unless done by Congress). Lincoln averted potential British intervention by defusing the </entity/>Trent-Affair Trent-Affair in late 1861. His complex moves toward ending slavery centered on the </entity/>Emancipation-Proclamation Emancipation-Proclamation in 1863, using the Army to protect escaped slaves, encouraging the border states to outlaw slavery, and helping push through Congress the </entity/>Thirteenth-Amendment-to-the-United-States-Constitution Thirteenth-Amendment-to-the-United-States-Constitution, which permanently outlawed slavery. Lincoln closely supervised the war effort, especially the selection of top generals, including his most successful general </entity/>Ulysses-S.-Grant Ulysses-S.-Grant. He made the major decisions on Union war strategy. Lincoln's Navy set up a naval blockade that shut down the South's normal trade, helped take control of Kentucky and Tennessee, and gained control of the Southern river system using gunboats. Lincoln tried repeatedly to capture the Confederate capital at </entity/>Richmond,-Virginia </mention/>Richmond; each time a general failed, Lincoln substituted another, until finally Grant succeeded in 1865.
An exceptionally astute politician deeply involved with power issues in each state, Lincoln reached out to "</entity/>War-Democrats War-Democrats" (who supported the North against the South), and managed his own re-election in the </entity/>United-States-presidential-election,-1864 </mention/>1864-presidential-election. As the leader of the moderate faction of the Republican party, Lincoln confronted Radical Republicans who demanded harsher treatment of the South, War Democrats who called for more compromise, antiwar Democrats called </entity/>Copperhead-(politics) </mention/>Copperheads who despised him, and irreconcilable secessionists who plotted his death. Politically, Lincoln fought back by pitting his opponents against each other, by appealing to the American people with his powers of oratory, and by carefully planned political patronage. His </entity/>Gettysburg-Address Gettysburg-Address of 1863 became an iconic statement of America's dedication to the principles of nationalism, republicanism, equal rights, liberty, and democracy. Lincoln held a moderate view of </entity/>Reconstruction-Era-of-the-United-States </mention/>Reconstruction, seeking to reunite the nation speedily through a policy of generous reconciliation in the face of lingering and bitter divisiveness. Six days after the surrender of Confederate commanding general </entity/>Robert-E.-Lee Robert-E.-Lee, Lincoln was assassinated by </entity/>John-Wilkes-Booth John-Wilkes-Booth, a noted actor and Confederate sympathizer.
Lincoln has been consistently </entity/>Historical-rankings-of-Presidents-of-the-United-States#Scholar-survey-results </mention/>ranked both by scholars and the public as one of the greatest U.S. presidents.
Family and childhood.
Early life.
Abraham Lincoln was born February 12, 1809, the second child of </entity/>Thomas-Lincoln Thomas-Lincoln and </entity/>Nancy-Lincoln Nancy-Lincoln (née Hanks), in a one-room log cabin on the </entity/>Sinking-Spring-Farm Sinking-Spring-Farm in </entity/>Hardin-County,-Kentucky </mention/>Hardin-County, Kentucky (now </entity/>LaRue-County,-Kentucky </mention/>LaRue-County). He is descended from </entity/>Samuel-Lincoln Samuel-Lincoln, who arrived in </entity/>Hingham,-Massachusetts </mention/>Hingham, Massachusetts, from </entity/>Norfolk Norfolk, England, in the 17th century. Lincoln's paternal grandfather and namesake, </entity/>Abraham-Lincoln-(captain) </mention/>Abraham, had moved his family from Virginia to Kentucky, where he was ambushed and killed in an </entity/>Northwest-Indian-War </mention/>Indian-raid in 1786, as his children, including Lincoln's father Thomas, looked on. Thomas was left to make his own way on the frontier.
Lincoln's mother, Nancy, was the daughter of Lucy Hanks, and was born in what is now </entity/>Mineral-County,-West-Virginia </mention/>Mineral-County, West Virginia, then part of Virginia. Lucy moved with Nancy to Kentucky. Nancy Hanks married Thomas, who became a respected citizen. He bought or leased several farms, including </entity/>Knob-Creek-Farm Knob-Creek-Farm. The family attended a </entity/>Separate-Baptists Separate-Baptists church, which had restrictive moral standards and opposed alcohol, dancing, and slavery. Thomas enjoyed considerable status in Kentucky—where he sat on juries, appraised estates, served on country slave patrols, and guarded prisoners. By the time his son Abraham was born, Thomas owned two farms, several town lots, livestock, and horses. He was among the richest men in the county. However, in 1816, Thomas lost all of his land in court cases because of faulty property titles.
According to William Ensign Lincoln's book "The Ancestry of Abraham Lincoln", Abraham Lincoln's mother, Nancy Hanks, was the daughter of Joseph Hanks and Nancy Shipley.
</entity/>
The family </entity/>Lincoln-Boyhood-National-Memorial </mention/>moved-north-across-the-Ohio-River to free (i.e., non-slave) territory and made a new start in what was then </entity/>Perry-County,-Indiana#History </mention/>Perry-County but is now </entity/>Spencer-County,-Indiana Spencer-County,-Indiana. Lincoln later noted that this move was "partly on account of slavery" but mainly due to land title difficulties. In Indiana, when Lincoln was nine, his mother Nancy died of </entity/>milk-sickness milk-sickness in 1818. After the death of Lincoln's mother, his older sister, </entity/>Sarah-Lincoln-Grigsby </mention/>Sarah, took charge of caring for him until their father remarried in 1819; Sarah later died in her 20s while giving birth to a </entity/>stillborn stillborn son.
Thomas Lincoln's new wife was the widow </entity/>Sarah-Bush-Lincoln </mention/>Sarah-Bush-Johnston, the mother of three children. Lincoln became very close to his stepmother, and referred to her as "Mother". As a pre-teen, he did not like the hard labor associated with frontier life. Some in his family, and in the neighborhood, for a time considered him to be lazy. As he grew into his teens, he willingly took responsibility for all chores expected of him as one of the boys in the household and became an adept axeman in his work building rail fences. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match to which he was challenged by the renowned leader of a group of ruffians, "the Clary's Grove boys".
Lincoln also agreed with the customary obligation of a son to give his father all earnings from work done outside the home until age 21. In later years, Lincoln occasionally lent his father money. Lincoln became increasingly distant from his father, in part because of his father's lack of education. While young Lincoln's formal education consisted approximately of a year's worth of classes from several itinerant teachers, he was mostly self-educated and was an avid reader and often sought access to any new books in the village. He read and reread the "</entity/>King-James-Bible King-James-Bible," </entity/>Aesop Aesop's "Fables," </entity/>John-Bunyan </mention/>Bunyan's "Pilgrim's Progress," </entity/>Daniel-Defoe </mention/>Defoe's "Robinson Crusoe," and </entity/>Benjamin-Franklin </mention/>Franklin's "Autobiography."
In 1830, fearing a milk sickness outbreak along the Ohio River, the Lincoln family moved west, where they settled on public land 10 miles west of </entity/>Decatur,-Illinois </mention/>Decatur, in </entity/>Macon-County,-Illinois </mention/>Macon-County, Illinois, another free, non-slave state. In 1831, Thomas relocated the family to a </entity/>Lincoln-Log-Cabin-State-Historic-Site </mention/>new-homestead in </entity/>Coles-County,-Illinois </mention/>Coles-County, Illinois. It was then that, as an ambitious 22-year-old who was now old enough to make his own decisions, Lincoln struck out on his own. Canoeing down the </entity/>Sangamon-River Sangamon-River, Lincoln ended up in the village of </entity/>New-Salem,-Menard-County,-Illinois </mention/>New-Salem in </entity/>Sangamon-County,-Illinois </mention/>Sangamon-County. In the spring of 1831, hired by a New Salem businessman </entity/>Denton-Offutt Denton-Offutt and accompanied by friends, he took goods by </entity/>flatboat flatboat from New Salem to New Orleans via the Sangamon, Illinois, and Mississippi rivers. After arriving in New Orleans—and witnessing slavery firsthand—he walked back home.
Marriage and children.
Lincoln's first romantic interest was </entity/>Ann-Rutledge Ann-Rutledge, whom he met when he first moved to New Salem; by 1835, they were in a relationship but not formally engaged. She died at the age of 22 on August 25, 1835, most likely of </entity/>typhoid-fever typhoid-fever. In the early 1830s, he met Mary Owens from Kentucky when she was visiting her sister.
Late in 1836, Lincoln agreed to a match with Mary if she returned to New Salem. Mary did return in November 1836, and Lincoln courted her for a time; however, they both had second thoughts about their relationship. On August 16, 1837, Lincoln wrote Mary a letter suggesting he would not blame her if she ended the relationship. She never replied and the courtship ended.
In 1840, Lincoln became engaged to </entity/>Mary-Todd-Lincoln </mention/>Mary-Todd, who was from a wealthy slave-holding family in </entity/>Lexington,-Kentucky </mention/>Lexington, Kentucky. They met in </entity/>Springfield,-Illinois </mention/>Springfield, Illinois, in December 1839 and were engaged the following December.
A wedding set for January 1, 1841, was canceled when the two broke off their engagement at Lincoln's initiative. They later met again at a party and married on November 4, 1842, in the Springfield mansion of Mary's married sister. While preparing for the nuptials and feeling anxiety again, Lincoln, when asked where he was going, replied, "To hell, I suppose."
In 1844, the couple bought </entity/>Lincoln-Home-National-Historic-Site </mention/>a-house in Springfield near Lincoln's law office. Mary Todd Lincoln kept house, often with the help of a relative or hired servant girl. </entity/>Robert-Todd-Lincoln Robert-Todd-Lincoln was born in 1843 and </entity/>Edward-Baker-Lincoln Edward-Baker-Lincoln (Eddie) in 1846. Lincoln "was remarkably fond of children", and the Lincolns were not considered to be strict with their children.
Edward died on February 1, 1850, in Springfield, probably of tuberculosis. </entity/>William-Wallace-Lincoln </mention/>"Willie"-Lincoln was born on December 21, 1850, and died of a fever on February 20, 1862. The Lincolns' fourth son, </entity/>Tad-Lincoln </mention/>Thomas-"Tad"-Lincoln, was born on April 4, 1853, and died of heart failure at the age of 18 on July 16, 1871. Robert was the only child to live to adulthood and have children. His last descendant, great-grandson </entity/>Robert-Todd-Lincoln-Beckwith Robert-Todd-Lincoln-Beckwith, died in 1985.
The deaths of their sons had profound effects on both parents. Later in life, Mary struggled with the stresses of losing her husband and sons, and Robert Lincoln committed her temporarily to a mental health asylum in 1875. Abraham Lincoln suffered from "</entity/>History-of-depression </mention/>melancholy," a condition which now is referred to as </entity/>Major-depressive-disorder </mention/>clinical-depression.
Lincoln's father-in-law and others of the Todd family were either slave owners or slave traders. Lincoln was close to the Todds, and he and his family occasionally visited the Todd estate in Lexington. He was an affectionate, though often absent, husband and father of four children.
Early career and militia service.
</entity/>
In 1832, at age 23, Lincoln and a partner bought a small general store on credit in </entity/>Lincoln's-New-Salem </mention/>New-Salem, Illinois. Although the economy was booming in the region, the business struggled and Lincoln eventually sold his share. That March he began his political career with his first campaign for the </entity/>Illinois-General-Assembly Illinois-General-Assembly. He had attained local popularity and could draw crowds as a natural </entity/>raconteur raconteur in New Salem, though he lacked an education, powerful friends, and money, which may be why he lost. He advocated navigational improvements on the Sangamon River.
Before the election, Lincoln served as a captain in the Illinois Militia during the </entity/>Black-Hawk-War Black-Hawk-War. Following his return, Lincoln continued his campaign for the August 6 election for the Illinois General Assembly. At , he was tall and "strong enough to intimidate any rival". At his first speech, when he saw a supporter in the crowd being attacked, Lincoln grabbed the assailant by his "neck and the seat of his trousers" and threw him. Lincoln finished eighth out of 13 candidates (the top four were elected), though he received 277 of the 300 votes cast in the New Salem precinct.
Lincoln served as New Salem's postmaster and later as county surveyor, all the while reading voraciously. He then decided to become a lawyer and began teaching himself law by reading </entity/>William-Blackstone </mention/>Blackstone's "</entity/>Commentaries-on-the-Laws-of-England Commentaries-on-the-Laws-of-England" and other law books. Of his learning method, Lincoln stated: "I studied with nobody". His second campaign in 1834 was successful. He won election to the state legislature; though he ran as a </entity/>Whig-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Whig, many Democrats favored him over a more powerful Whig opponent.
</entity/>Admission-to-the-bar-in-the-United-States </mention/>Admitted-to-the-bar in 1836, he moved to Springfield, Illinois, and began to practice law under </entity/>John-T.-Stuart John-T.-Stuart, Mary Todd's cousin. Lincoln became an able and successful lawyer with a reputation as a formidable adversary during cross-examinations and closing arguments. He partnered with </entity/>Stephen-T.-Logan Stephen-T.-Logan from 1841 until 1844, when he began </entity/>Lincoln-Herndon-Law-Offices-State-Historic-Site </mention/>his-practice with </entity/>William-Herndon-(lawyer) </mention/>William-Herndon, whom Lincoln thought "a studious young man". He served four successive terms in the </entity/>Illinois-House-of-Representatives Illinois-House-of-Representatives as a Whig representative from Sangamon County.
In the 1835–36 legislative session, he voted to expand suffrage to white males, whether landowners or not. He was known for his "free soil" stance of opposing both slavery and </entity/>Abolitionism-in-the-United-States </mention/>abolitionism. He first articulated this in 1837, saying, "[The] Institution of slavery is founded on both injustice and bad policy, but the promulgation of abolition doctrines tends rather to increase than abate its evils." His stance closely followed </entity/>Henry-Clay Henry-Clay in supporting the </entity/>American-Colonization-Society American-Colonization-Society program of making the abolition of slavery practical by its advocation and helping the freed slaves to settle in </entity/>Liberia Liberia in Africa.
Congressman Lincoln.
</entity/>
From the early 1830s, Lincoln was a steadfast Whig and professed to friends in 1861 to be, "an old line Whig, a disciple of Henry Clay". The party, including Lincoln, favored economic modernization in banking, protective tariffs to fund </entity/>internal-improvements internal-improvements including railroads, and espoused urbanization as well.
In 1846, Lincoln was elected to the </entity/>United-States-House-of-Representatives </mention/>U.S.-House-of-Representatives, where he served one two-year term. He was the only Whig in the Illinois delegation, but he showed his party loyalty by participating in almost all votes and making speeches that echoed the party line. Lincoln, in collaboration with abolitionist Congressman </entity/>Joshua-R.-Giddings Joshua-R.-Giddings, wrote a bill to abolish slavery in the </entity/>Washington,-District-of-Columbia </mention/>District-of-Columbia with compensation for the owners, enforcement to capture fugitive slaves, and a popular vote on the matter. He abandoned the bill when it failed to garner sufficient Whig supporters.
On foreign and military policy, Lincoln spoke out against the </entity/>Mexican–American-War Mexican–American-War, which he attributed to </entity/>James-K.-Polk </mention/>President-Polk's desire for "military glory—that attractive rainbow, that rises in showers of blood". Lincoln also supported the </entity/>Wilmot-Proviso Wilmot-Proviso, which, if it had been adopted, would have banned slavery in any U.S. territory won from Mexico.
Lincoln emphasized his opposition to Polk by drafting and introducing his </entity/>Spot-Resolutions Spot-Resolutions. The war had begun with a Mexican slaughter of American soldiers in territory disputed by Mexico and the U.S. Polk insisted that Mexican soldiers had "invaded "our territory" and shed the blood of our fellow-citizens on our "own soil". Lincoln demanded that Polk show Congress the exact spot on which blood had been shed and prove that the spot was on American soil.
Congress never enacted the resolution or even debated it, the national papers ignored it, and it resulted in a loss of political support for Lincoln in his district. One Illinois newspaper derisively nicknamed him "spotty Lincoln". Lincoln later regretted some of his statements, especially his attack on the presidential war-making powers.
Realizing Clay was unlikely to win the presidency, Lincoln, who had pledged in 1846 to serve only one term in the House, supported General </entity/>Zachary-Taylor Zachary-Taylor for the Whig nomination in the </entity/>United-States-presidential-election,-1848 </mention/>1848-presidential-election. Taylor won and Lincoln hoped to be appointed Commissioner of the </entity/>General-Land-Office General-Land-Office, but that lucrative patronage job went to an Illinois rival, </entity/>Justin-Butterfield Justin-Butterfield, considered by the administration to be a highly skilled lawyer, but in Lincoln's view, an "old fossil". The administration offered him the consolation prize of secretary or governor of the </entity/>Oregon-Territory Oregon-Territory. This distant territory was a Democratic stronghold, and acceptance of the post would have effectively ended his legal and political career in Illinois, so he declined and resumed his law practice.
Prairie lawyer.
Lincoln returned to practicing law in Springfield, handling "every kind of business that could come before a prairie lawyer". Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. Lincoln handled many transportation cases in the midst of the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a </entity/>Hurd-v.-Rock-Island-Bridge-Company </mention/>landmark-case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. In 1849, he received </entity/>Abraham-Lincoln's-patent </mention/>a-patent-for-a-flotation-device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.
In 1851, he represented the </entity/>Alton-Railroad </mention/>Alton-&-Sangamon-Railroad in a dispute with one of its shareholders, James A. Barret, who had refused to pay the balance on his pledge to buy shares in the railroad on the grounds that the company had changed its original train route. Lincoln successfully argued that the railroad company was not bound by its original charter in existence at the time of Barret's pledge; the charter was amended in the public interest to provide a newer, superior, and less expensive route, and the corporation retained the right to demand Barret's payment. The decision by the </entity/>Supreme-Court-of-Illinois </mention/>Illinois-Supreme-Court has been cited by numerous other courts in the nation. Lincoln appeared before the Illinois Supreme Court in 175 cases, in 51 as sole counsel, of which 31 were decided in his favor. From 1853 to 1860, another of Lincoln's largest clients was the </entity/>Illinois-Central-Railroad Illinois-Central-Railroad.
Lincoln's most notable criminal trial occurred in 1858 when he defended </entity/>William-"Duff"-Armstrong William-"Duff"-Armstrong, who was on trial for the murder of James Preston Metzker. The case is famous for Lincoln's use of a fact established by </entity/>judicial-notice judicial-notice in order to challenge the credibility of an eyewitness. After an opposing witness testified seeing the crime in the moonlight, Lincoln produced a "</entity/>Farmers'-Almanac Farmers'-Almanac" showing the moon was at a low angle, drastically reducing visibility. Based on this evidence, Armstrong was acquitted.
Lincoln rarely raised objections in the courtroom; but in an 1859 case, where he defended a cousin, Peachy Harrison, who was accused of stabbing another to death, Lincoln angrily protested the judge's decision to exclude evidence favorable to his client. Instead of holding Lincoln in contempt of court as was expected, the judge, a Democrat, reversed his ruling, allowing the evidence and acquitting Harrison.
Republican politics 1854–60.
Slavery and a "House Divided".
By the 1850s, slavery was still legal in the southern United States, but had been generally outlawed in the northern states, including Illinois, whose original 1818 Constitution forbade slavery, as required by the </entity/>Northwest-Ordinance Northwest-Ordinance. Lincoln disapproved of slavery, and the spread of slavery to new U.S. territory in the west. He returned to politics to oppose the pro-slavery </entity/>Kansas–Nebraska-Act Kansas–Nebraska-Act (1854); this law repealed the slavery-restricting </entity/>Missouri-Compromise Missouri-Compromise (1820). Senior Senator </entity/>Stephen-A.-Douglas Stephen-A.-Douglas of Illinois had incorporated </entity/>Popular-sovereignty-in-the-United-States#Emergence-of-the-term-"popular-sovereignty"-and-its-pejorative-connotation </mention/>popular-sovereignty into the Act. Douglas' provision, which Lincoln opposed, specified settlers had the right to determine locally whether to allow slavery in new U.S. territory, rather than have such a decision restricted by the national Congress.
</entity/>Eric-Foner Eric-Foner (2010) contrasts the abolitionists and anti-slavery Radical Republicans of the Northeast who saw slavery as a sin, with the conservative Republicans who thought it was bad because it hurt white people and blocked progress. Foner argues that Lincoln was a moderate in the middle, opposing slavery primarily because it violated the </entity/>Republicanism-in-the-United-States </mention/>republicanism-principles of the </entity/>Founding-Fathers Founding-Fathers, especially the equality of all men and democratic self-government as expressed in the </entity/>United-States-Declaration-of-Independence </mention/>Declaration-of-Independence.
</entity/>
On October 16, 1854, in his "</entity/>Abraham-Lincoln-Peoria-speech </mention/>Peoria-Speech", Lincoln declared his opposition to slavery, which he repeated en route to the presidency. Speaking in his Kentucky accent, with a very powerful voice, he said the Kansas Act had a ""declared" indifference, but as I must think, a covert "real" zeal for the spread of slavery. I cannot but hate it. I hate it because of the monstrous injustice of slavery itself. I hate it because it deprives our republican example of its just influence in the world ..."
In late 1854, Lincoln ran as a Whig for the U.S. Senate seat from Illinois. At that time, senators were elected by the state legislature. After leading in the first six rounds of voting in the Illinois assembly, his support began to dwindle, and Lincoln instructed his backers to vote for </entity/>Lyman-Trumbull Lyman-Trumbull, who defeated opponent </entity/>Joel-Aldrich-Matteson Joel-Aldrich-Matteson. The Whigs had been irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Lincoln wrote, "I think I am a Whig, but others say there are no Whigs, and that I am an abolitionist [...] I do no more than oppose the "extension" of slavery."
Drawing on remnants of the old Whig party, and on disenchanted </entity/>Free-Soil-Party </mention/>Free-Soil, </entity/>Liberty-Party-(United-States,-1840) </mention/>Liberty, and </entity/>Democratic-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Democratic-Party members, he was instrumental in forging the shape of the new </entity/>Republican-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Republican-Party. At the </entity/>1856-Republican-National-Convention 1856-Republican-National-Convention, Lincoln placed second in the contest to become the party's candidate for vice president.
In 1857–1858, Douglas broke with President </entity/>James-Buchanan James-Buchanan, leading to a fight for control of the Democratic Party. Some eastern Republicans even favored the reelection of Douglas for the Senate in 1858, since he had led the opposition to the </entity/>Lecompton-Constitution Lecompton-Constitution, which would have admitted Kansas as a </entity/>slave-state slave-state. In March 1857, the Supreme Court issued its decision in "</entity/>Dred-Scott-v.-Sandford Dred-Scott-v.-Sandford"; Chief Justice </entity/>Roger-B.-Taney Roger-B.-Taney opined that blacks were not citizens, and derived no rights from the Constitution. Lincoln denounced the decision, alleging it was the product of a conspiracy of Democrats to support the </entity/>Slave-Power Slave-Power. Lincoln argued, "The authors of the Declaration of Independence never intended 'to say all were equal in color, size, intellect, moral developments, or social capacity', but they 'did consider all men created equal—equal in certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness'."
After the state Republican party convention nominated him for the U.S. Senate in 1858, Lincoln delivered his </entity/>Lincoln's-House-Divided-Speech </mention/>House-Divided-Speech, drawing on , "A house divided against itself cannot stand. I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free. I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided. It will become all one thing, or all the other." The speech created an evocative image of the danger of disunion caused by the slavery debate, and rallied Republicans across the North. The stage was then set for the campaign for statewide election of the Illinois legislature which would, in turn, select Lincoln or Douglas as its U.S. senator.
Lincoln–Douglas debates and Cooper Union speech.
</entity/>
The Senate campaign featured the seven </entity/>Lincoln–Douglas-debates Lincoln–Douglas-debates of 1858, the most famous political debates in American history. The principals stood in stark contrast both physically and politically. Lincoln warned that "</entity/>The-Slave-Power The-Slave-Power" was threatening the values of republicanism, and accused Douglas of distorting the values of the Founding Fathers that </entity/>all-men-are-created-equal all-men-are-created-equal, while Douglas emphasized his </entity/>Freeport-Doctrine Freeport-Doctrine, that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery or not, and accused Lincoln of having joined the abolitionists. The debates had an atmosphere of a prize fight and drew crowds in the thousands. Lincoln stated Douglas' </entity/>popular-sovereignty popular-sovereignty theory was a threat to the nation's morality and that Douglas represented a conspiracy to extend slavery to free states. Douglas said that Lincoln was defying the authority of the U.S. Supreme Court and the "Dred Scott" decision.
Though the Republican legislative candidates won more popular votes, the Democrats won more seats, and the legislature re-elected Douglas to the Senate. Despite the bitterness of the defeat for Lincoln, his articulation of the issues gave him a national political reputation. In May 1859, Lincoln purchased the "Illinois Staats-Anzeiger," a German-language newspaper which was consistently supportive; most of the state's 130,000 German Americans voted Democratic but there was Republican support that a German-language paper could mobilize.
On February 27, 1860, New York party leaders invited Lincoln to give a </entity/>Cooper-Union-speech </mention/>speech-at-Cooper-Union to a group of powerful Republicans. Lincoln argued that the Founding Fathers had little use for popular sovereignty and had repeatedly sought to restrict slavery. Lincoln insisted the moral foundation of the Republicans required opposition to slavery, and rejected any "groping for some middle ground between the right and the wrong". Despite his inelegant appearance—many in the audience thought him awkward and even ugly—Lincoln demonstrated an intellectual leadership that brought him into the front ranks of the party and into contention for the Republican presidential nomination. Journalist </entity/>Noah-Brooks Noah-Brooks reported, "No man ever before made such an impression on his first appeal to a New York audience."
Historian </entity/>David-Herbert-Donald </mention/>Donald described the speech as a "superb political move for an unannounced candidate, to appear in one rival's (</entity/>William-H.-Seward William-H.-Seward) own state at an event sponsored by the second rival's (</entity/>Salmon-P.-Chase Salmon-P.-Chase) loyalists, while not mentioning either by name during its delivery". In response to an inquiry about his presidential intentions, Lincoln said, "The taste "is" in my mouth a little."
1860 Presidential nomination and campaign.
</entity/>
On May 9–10, 1860, the Illinois Republican State Convention was held in Decatur. Lincoln's followers organized a campaign team led by </entity/>David-Davis-(Supreme-Court-justice) </mention/>David-Davis, </entity/>Norman-B.-Judd </mention/>Norman-Judd, </entity/>Leonard-Swett Leonard-Swett, and Jesse DuBois, and Lincoln received his first endorsement to run for the presidency. Exploiting the embellished legend of his frontier days with his father (clearing the land and splitting fence rails with an ax), Lincoln's supporters adopted the label of "The Rail Candidate".
On May 18, at the </entity/>1860-Republican-National-Convention </mention/>Republican-National-Convention in Chicago, Lincoln's friends promised and manipulated and won the nomination on the third ballot, beating candidates such as William H. Seward and Salmon P. Chase. A former Democrat, </entity/>Hannibal-Hamlin Hannibal-Hamlin of Maine, was nominated for Vice President to balance the ticket. Lincoln's success depended on his reputation as a moderate on the slavery issue, and his strong support for Whiggish programs of internal improvements and the protective tariff.
On the third ballot Pennsylvania put him over the top. Pennsylvania iron interests were reassured by his support for protective tariffs. Lincoln's managers had been adroitly focused on this delegation as well as the others, while following Lincoln's strong dictate to "Make no contracts that bind me".
Most Republicans agreed with Lincoln that the North was the aggrieved party, as the Slave Power tightened its grasp on the national government with the "Dred Scott" decision and the presidency of James Buchanan. Throughout the 1850s, Lincoln doubted the prospects of civil war, and his supporters rejected claims that his election would incite secession. Meanwhile, Douglas was selected as the candidate of the Northern Democrats. Delegates from 11 slave states walked out of the </entity/>1860-Democratic-National-Convention </mention/>Democratic-convention, disagreeing with Douglas' position on popular sovereignty, and ultimately selected </entity/>John-C.-Breckinridge John-C.-Breckinridge as their candidate.
As Douglas and the other candidates went through with their campaigns, Lincoln was the only one of them who gave no speeches. Instead, he monitored the campaign closely and relied on the enthusiasm of the Republican Party. The party did the leg work that produced majorities across the North, and produced an abundance of campaign posters, leaflets, and newspaper editorials. There were thousands of Republican speakers who focused first on the party platform, and second on Lincoln's life story, emphasizing his childhood poverty. The goal was to demonstrate the superior power of "free labor", whereby a common farm boy could work his way to the top by his own efforts. The Republican Party's production of campaign literature dwarfed the combined opposition; a "Chicago Tribune" writer produced a pamphlet that detailed Lincoln's life, and sold 100,000 to 200,000 copies.
Presidency.
1860 election and secession.
On November 6, 1860, Lincoln was elected the 16th president of the United States, beating Democrat Stephen A. Douglas, John C. Breckinridge of the Southern Democrats, and </entity/>John-Bell-(Tennessee-politician) </mention/>John-Bell of the new </entity/>Constitutional-Union-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Constitutional-Union-Party. He was the first president from the Republican Party. His victory was entirely due to the strength of his support in the North and West; no ballots were cast for him in 10 of the 15 Southern slave states, and he won only two of 996 counties in all the Southern states.
Lincoln received 1,866,452 votes, Douglas 1,376,957 votes, Breckinridge 849,781 votes, and Bell 588,789 votes. Turnout was 82.2 percent, with Lincoln winning the free Northern states, as well as California and Oregon. Douglas won Missouri, and split New Jersey with Lincoln. Bell won Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky, and Breckinridge won the rest of the South.
Although Lincoln won only a plurality of the popular vote, his victory in the </entity/>United-States-Electoral-College </mention/>electoral-college was decisive: Lincoln had 180 and his opponents added together had only 123. There were </entity/>Electoral-fusion </mention/>fusion-tickets in which all of Lincoln's opponents combined to support the same slate of Electors in New York, New Jersey, and Rhode Island, but even if the anti-Lincoln vote had been combined in every state, Lincoln still would have won a majority in the Electoral College.
</entity/>
As Lincoln's election became evident, secessionists made clear their intent to leave the Union before he took office the next March. On December 20, 1860, South Carolina took the lead by adopting an ordinance of secession; by February 1, 1861, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas followed. Six of these states then adopted a constitution and declared themselves to be a sovereign nation, the </entity/>Confederate-States-of-America Confederate-States-of-America. The upper South and border states (Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and Arkansas) listened to, but initially rejected, the secessionist appeal. President Buchanan and President-elect Lincoln refused to recognize the Confederacy, declaring secession illegal. The Confederacy selected </entity/>Jefferson-Davis Jefferson-Davis as its provisional President on February 9, 1861.
There were attempts at compromise. The </entity/>Crittenden-Compromise Crittenden-Compromise would have extended the </entity/>Missouri-Compromise Missouri-Compromise line of 1820, dividing the territories into slave and free, contrary to the Republican Party's free-soil platform. Lincoln rejected the idea, saying, "I will suffer death before I consent ... to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right."
Lincoln, however, did tacitly support the proposed </entity/>Corwin-Amendment Corwin-Amendment to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln came into office and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent. A few weeks before the war, Lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.
En route to his inauguration by train, Lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the North. The president-elect then </entity/>Baltimore-Plot </mention/>evaded-possible-assassins in Baltimore, who were uncovered by Lincoln's head of security, </entity/>Allan-Pinkerton Allan-Pinkerton. On February 23, 1861, he arrived in disguise in Washington, D.C., which was placed under substantial military guard. Lincoln directed his </entity/>Lincoln's-first-inaugural-address </mention/>inaugural-address to the South, proclaiming once again that he had no intention, or inclination, to abolish slavery in the Southern states:
The President ended his address with an appeal to the people of the South: "We are not enemies, but friends. We must not be enemies ... The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield, and patriot grave, to every living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angels of our nature." The failure of the </entity/>Peace-Conference-of-1861 Peace-Conference-of-1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible. By March 1861, no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the Union on any terms. Meanwhile, Lincoln and the Republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the Union could not be tolerated. Lincoln said as the war was ending:
Beginning of the war.
</entity/>
The commander of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, </entity/>Robert-Anderson-(Civil-War) </mention/>Major-Robert-Anderson, sent a request for provisions to Washington, and the execution of Lincoln's order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war. On April 12, 1861, Confederate forces fired on Union troops at </entity/>Battle-of-Fort-Sumter </mention/>Fort-Sumter, forcing them to surrender, and began the war. Historian </entity/>Allan-Nevins Allan-Nevins argued that the newly inaugurated Lincoln made three miscalculations: underestimating the gravity of the crisis, exaggerating the strength of Unionist sentiment in the South, and not realizing the Southern Unionists were insisting there be no invasion.
</entity/>William-Tecumseh-Sherman William-Tecumseh-Sherman talked to Lincoln during inauguration week and was "sadly disappointed" at his failure to realize that "the country was sleeping on a volcano" and that the South was preparing for war. Donald concludes that, "His repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on Ft. Sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood. But he also vowed not to surrender the forts. The only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot; they did just that."
On April 15, Lincoln called on all the states to send detachments totaling 75,000 troops to recapture forts, protect Washington, and "preserve the Union", which, in his view, still existed intact despite the actions of the seceding states. This call forced the states to choose sides. Virginia declared its secession and was rewarded with the Confederate capital, despite the exposed position of </entity/>Richmond,-Virginia </mention/>Richmond so close to Union lines. North Carolina, Tennessee, and Arkansas also voted for secession over the next two months. Secession sentiment was strong in Missouri and Maryland, but did not prevail; Kentucky tried to be neutral.
Troops from northern states headed south to fight in response to Lincoln's call. On April 19, anti-war mobs in Baltimore, which controlled the rail links, </entity/>Baltimore-riot-of-1861 </mention/>attacked-Union-troops heading south. </entity/>George-William-Brown George-William-Brown, the Mayor of Baltimore, the entire city council, all the police commissioners, </entity/>Henry-May-(Maryland) </mention/>a-sitting-U.S.-Congresman and other Maryland politicians were arrested and imprisoned, without warrants, charges, or trials, as Lincoln unilaterally suspended the writ of "</entity/>Habeas-corpus-in-the-United-States#Suspension-during-the-Civil-War </mention/>habeas-corpus". </entity/>John-Merryman John-Merryman, a Maryland official, petitioned U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice </entity/>Roger-B.-Taney Roger-B.-Taney to issue a writ of "habeas corpus," saying holding Merryman without a hearing was unlawful. Taney issued the writ, stating that Lincoln's unilateral suspension of habeas corpus was unconstitutional (and that only Congress could suspend habeas corpus), but Lincoln ignored </entity/>Ex-parte-Merryman </mention/>the-ruling. Indeed, when Lincoln's, perhaps unlawful, dismissal of the U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice's ruling was criticized in an editorial by Francis Scott Key's grandson, Baltimore newspaper editor </entity/>Frank-Key-Howard Frank-Key-Howard, he was himself arrested without any charge or trial. (Ironically, federal troops imprisoned the young newspaper editor in </entity/>Fort-McHenry Fort-McHenry, which, as he noted, was the same fort where the </entity/>Star-Spangled-Banner Star-Spangled-Banner had been waving "o'er the land of the free" in his grandfather's song.) Shortly thereafter, on the day the Maryland legislature was to reconvene, Lincoln imprisoned one third of the members of the </entity/>Maryland-General-Assembly Maryland-General-Assembly without charges or hearings in further defiance of the Chief Justice's ruling. Thus, the legislative session had to be cancelled, and no response to Lincoln's possibly unconstitutional acts could be considered. Then and throughout the war, Lincoln came under heavy attack from antiwar Democrats, called </entity/>Copperhead-(politics) </mention/>Copperheads.
Assuming command for the Union in the war.
After the </entity/>Battle-of-Fort-Sumter Battle-of-Fort-Sumter, Lincoln realized the importance of taking immediate executive control of the war and making an overall strategy to put down the rebellion. Lincoln encountered an unprecedented political and military crisis, and he responded as </entity/>commander-in-chief commander-in-chief, using unprecedented powers. He expanded his war powers, and imposed a blockade on all the Confederate shipping ports, disbursed funds before appropriation by Congress, and after suspending "habeas corpus", arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected Confederate sympathizers and anti-war figures. Lincoln was supported by Congress and the northern public for these actions. In addition, Lincoln had to contend with reinforcing strong Union sympathies in the border slave states and keeping the war from becoming an international conflict.
</entity/>
The war effort was the source of continued disparagement of Lincoln, and dominated his time and attention. From the start, it was clear that bipartisan support would be essential to success in the war effort, and any manner of compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle, such as the appointment of Republicans and Democrats to command positions in the Union Army. Copperheads criticized Lincoln for refusing to compromise on the slavery issue. Conversely, the Radical Republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery. On August 6, 1861, Lincoln signed the </entity/>Confiscation-Act-of-1861 </mention/>Confiscation-Act that authorized judiciary proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the Confederate war effort. In practice, the law had little effect, but it did signal political support for abolishing slavery in the Confederacy.
In late August 1861, General </entity/>John-C.-Frémont John-C.-Frémont, the 1856 Republican presidential nominee, issued, without consulting his superiors in Washington, a proclamation of </entity/>martial-law martial-law in Missouri. He declared that any citizen found bearing arms could be </entity/>court-martial court-martialed and shot, and that slaves of persons aiding the rebellion would be freed. Frémont was already under a cloud with charges of negligence in his command of the </entity/>Department-of-the-West Department-of-the-West compounded with allegations of fraud and corruption. Lincoln overruled Frémont's proclamation. Lincoln believed that Fremont's emancipation was political; neither militarily necessary nor legal. After Lincoln acted, Union enlistments from Maryland, Kentucky, and Missouri increased by over 40,000 troops.
The </entity/>Trent-Affair Trent-Affair of late 1861 threatened war with Great Britain. The U.S. Navy illegally intercepted a British merchant ship, the "Trent", on the high seas and seized two Confederate envoys; Britain protested vehemently while the U.S. cheered. Lincoln resolved the issue by releasing the two men and war was successfully averted with Britain. Lincoln's foreign policy approach had been initially hands off, due to his inexperience; he left most diplomacy appointments and other foreign policy matters to his Secretary of State, William Seward. Seward's initial reaction to the "Trent" affair, however, was too bellicose, so Lincoln also turned to Senator </entity/>Charles-Sumner Charles-Sumner, the chairman of the </entity/>Senate-Foreign-Relations-Committee Senate-Foreign-Relations-Committee and an expert in British diplomacy.
To learn technical military terms, Lincoln borrowed and studied </entity/>Henry-Halleck Henry-Halleck's book, "Elements of Military Art and Science" from the </entity/>Library-of-Congress Library-of-Congress. Lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraphic reports coming into the </entity/>United-States-War-Department </mention/>War-Department in Washington, D.C. He kept close tabs on all phases of the military effort, consulted with governors, and selected generals based on their past success (as well as their state and party). In January 1862, after many complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the War Department, Lincoln replaced </entity/>Simon-Cameron Simon-Cameron with </entity/>Edwin-Stanton Edwin-Stanton as </entity/>United-States-Secretary-of-War </mention/>War-Secretary. Stanton was a staunchly Unionist pro-business conservative Democrat who moved toward the Radical Republican faction. Nevertheless he worked more often and more closely with Lincoln than any other senior official. "Stanton and Lincoln virtually conducted the war together," say Thomas and Hyman.
In terms of war strategy, Lincoln articulated two priorities: to ensure that Washington was well-defended, and to conduct an aggressive war effort that would satisfy the demand in the North for prompt, decisive victory; major Northern newspaper editors expected victory within 90 days. Twice a week, Lincoln would meet with his cabinet in the afternoon, and occasionally Mary Lincoln would force him to take a carriage ride because she was concerned he was working too hard. Lincoln learned from his chief of staff General Henry Halleck, a student of the European strategist </entity/>Antoine-Henri-Jomini </mention/>Jomini, of the critical need to control strategic points, such as the Mississippi River; he also knew well the importance of </entity/>Vicksburg,-Mississippi </mention/>Vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemy's army, rather than simply capturing territory.
General McClellan.
After the Union defeat at the </entity/>First-Battle-of-Bull-Run First-Battle-of-Bull-Run and the retirement of the aged </entity/>Winfield-Scott Winfield-Scott in late 1861, Lincoln appointed Major General </entity/>George-B.-McClellan George-B.-McClellan general-in-chief of all the Union armies. McClellan, a young West Point graduate, railroad executive, and Pennsylvania Democrat, took several months to plan and attempt his </entity/>Peninsula-Campaign Peninsula-Campaign, longer than Lincoln wanted. The campaign's objective was to capture Richmond by moving the </entity/>Army-of-the-Potomac Army-of-the-Potomac by boat to the peninsula and then overland to the Confederate capital. McClellan's repeated delays frustrated Lincoln and Congress, as did his position that no troops were needed to defend Washington. Lincoln insisted on holding some of McClellan's troops in defense of the capital; McClellan, who consistently overestimated the strength of Confederate troops, blamed this decision for the ultimate failure of the Peninsula Campaign.
</entity/>
Lincoln removed McClellan as general-in-chief and appointed Henry Wager Halleck in March 1862, after McClellan's "Harrison's Landing Letter", in which he offered unsolicited political advice to Lincoln urging caution in the war effort. McClellan's letter incensed Radical Republicans, who successfully pressured Lincoln to appoint </entity/>John-Pope-(military-officer) </mention/>John-Pope, a Republican, as head of the new </entity/>Army-of-Virginia Army-of-Virginia. Pope complied with Lincoln's strategic desire to move toward Richmond from the north, thus protecting the capital from attack.
However, lacking requested reinforcements from McClellan, now commanding the Army of the Potomac, Pope was soundly defeated at the </entity/>Second-Battle-of-Bull-Run Second-Battle-of-Bull-Run in the summer of 1862, forcing the Army of the Potomac to defend Washington for a second time. The war also expanded with naval operations in 1862 when the </entity/>CSS-Virginia </mention/>CSS-"Virginia", formerly the USS "Merrimack", damaged or destroyed three Union vessels in Norfolk, Virginia, before being engaged and damaged by the </entity/>USS-Monitor </mention/>USS-"Monitor". Lincoln closely reviewed the dispatches and interrogated naval officers during their clash in the </entity/>Battle-of-Hampton-Roads Battle-of-Hampton-Roads.
Despite his dissatisfaction with McClellan's failure to reinforce Pope, Lincoln was desperate, and restored him to command of all forces around Washington, to the dismay of all in his cabinet but Seward. Two days after McClellan's return to command, General </entity/>Robert-E.-Lee Robert-E.-Lee's forces crossed the </entity/>Potomac-River Potomac-River into Maryland, leading to the </entity/>Battle-of-Antietam Battle-of-Antietam in September 1862. The ensuing Union victory was among the bloodiest in American history, but it enabled Lincoln to announce that he would issue an </entity/>Emancipation-Proclamation Emancipation-Proclamation in January. Having composed the Proclamation some time earlier, Lincoln had waited for a military victory to publish it to avoid it being perceived as the product of desperation.
McClellan then resisted the President's demand that he pursue Lee's retreating and exposed army, while his counterpart General </entity/>Don-Carlos-Buell Don-Carlos-Buell likewise refused orders to move the </entity/>Army-of-the-Ohio Army-of-the-Ohio against rebel forces in eastern Tennessee. As a result, Lincoln replaced Buell with </entity/>William-Rosecrans William-Rosecrans; and, after the 1862 midterm elections, he replaced McClellan with Republican </entity/>Ambrose-Burnside Ambrose-Burnside. Both of these replacements were political moderates and prospectively more supportive of the Commander-in-Chief.
</entity/>
Burnside, against the advice of the president, prematurely launched an offensive across the </entity/>Rappahannock-River Rappahannock-River and was stunningly </entity/>Battle-of-Fredericksburg </mention/>defeated-by-Lee-at-Fredericksburg in December. Not only had Burnside been defeated on the battlefield, but his soldiers were disgruntled and undisciplined. Desertions during 1863 were in the thousands and they increased after Fredericksburg. Lincoln brought in </entity/>Joseph-Hooker Joseph-Hooker, despite his record of loose talk about the need for a military dictatorship.
The </entity/>United-States-House-of-Representatives-elections,-1862 </mention/>mid-term-elections in 1862 brought the Republicans severe losses due to sharp disfavor with the administration over its failure to deliver a speedy end to the war, as well as rising inflation, new high taxes, rumors of corruption, the suspension of "habeas corpus," </entity/>Conscription </mention/>the-military-draft-law, and fears that freed slaves would undermine the labor market. The Emancipation Proclamation announced in September gained votes for the Republicans in the rural areas of New England and the upper Midwest, but it lost votes in the cities and the lower Midwest.
While Republicans were discouraged, Democrats were energized and did especially well in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, and New York. The Republicans did maintain their majorities in Congress and in the major states, except New York. The Cincinnati "Gazette" contended that the voters were "depressed by the interminable nature of this war, as so far conducted, and by the rapid exhaustion of the national resources without progress".
In the spring of 1863, Lincoln was optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to the point of thinking the end of the war could be near if a string of victories could be put together; these plans included Hooker's attack on Lee north of Richmond, Rosecrans' on Chattanooga, Grant's on Vicksburg, and a naval assault on Charleston.
Hooker was routed by Lee at the </entity/>Battle-of-Chancellorsville Battle-of-Chancellorsville in May, but continued to command his troops for some weeks. He ignored Lincoln's order to divide his troops, and possibly force Lee to do the same in </entity/>Harper's-Ferry Harper's-Ferry, and tendered his resignation, which Lincoln accepted. He was replaced by </entity/>George-Meade George-Meade, who followed Lee into Pennsylvania for the </entity/>Gettysburg-Campaign Gettysburg-Campaign, which was a victory for the Union, though Lee's army avoided capture. At the same time, after initial setbacks, Grant laid siege to Vicksburg and the Union navy attained some success in Charleston harbor.
After the Battle of Gettysburg, Lincoln clearly understood that his military decisions would be more effectively carried out by conveying his orders through his War Secretary or his general-in-chief on to his generals, who resented his civilian interference with their own plans. Even so, he often continued to give detailed directions to his generals as Commander-in-Chief.
Emancipation Proclamation.
</entity/>
Lincoln understood that the Federal government's power to end slavery was limited by the Constitution, which before 1865, committed the issue to individual states. He argued before and during his election that the eventual extinction of slavery would result from preventing its expansion into new U.S. territory. At the beginning of the war, he also sought to persuade the states to accept </entity/>compensated-emancipation compensated-emancipation in return for their prohibition of slavery. Lincoln believed that curtailing slavery in these ways would economically expunge it, as envisioned by the </entity/>Founding-Fathers-of-the-United-States </mention/>Founding-Fathers, under the constitution. President Lincoln rejected two geographically limited emancipation attempts by Major General John C. Frémont in August 1861 and by Major General </entity/>David-Hunter David-Hunter in May 1862, on the grounds that it was not within their power, and it would upset the border states loyal to the Union.
On June 19, 1862, endorsed by Lincoln, Congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory. In July 1862, the Second </entity/>Confiscation-Acts </mention/>Confiscation-Act was passed, which set up court procedures that could free the slaves of anyone convicted of aiding the rebellion. Although Lincoln believed it was not within Congress's power to free the slaves within the states, he approved the bill in deference to the legislature. He felt such action could only be taken by the Commander-in-Chief using war powers granted to the president by the Constitution, and Lincoln was planning to take that action. In that month, Lincoln discussed a draft of the Emancipation Proclamation with his cabinet. In it, he stated that "as a fit and necessary military measure, on January 1, 1863, all persons held as slaves in the Confederate states will thenceforward, and forever, be free".
Privately, Lincoln concluded at this point that the slave base of the Confederacy had to be eliminated. However Copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification. Republican editor </entity/>Horace-Greeley Horace-Greeley of the highly influential "New York Tribune" fell for the ploy, and Lincoln refuted it directly in a shrewd letter of August 22, 1862. The President said the primary goal of his actions as president (he used the first person pronoun and explicitly refers to his "official duty") was preserving the Union:
The Emancipation Proclamation, issued on September 22, 1862, and put into effect on January 1, 1863, declared free the slaves in 10 states not then under Union control, with exemptions specified for areas already under Union control in two states. Lincoln spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation, while Democrats rallied their voters in the 1862 off-year elections by warning of the threat freed slaves posed to northern whites.
Once the abolition of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was doing right, than I do in signing this paper." For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up </entity/>Abraham-Lincoln-on-slavery#Colonization </mention/>colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the </entity/>War-Governors'-Conference War-Governors'-Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B. McClellan as commander of the Union Army.
Enlisting former slaves in the military was official government policy after the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation. By the spring of 1863, Lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers. In a letter to </entity/>Andrew-Johnson Andrew-Johnson, the military governor of Tennessee, encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops, Lincoln wrote, "The bare sight of 50,000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the Mississippi would end the rebellion at once". By the end of 1863, at Lincoln's direction, General </entity/>Lorenzo-Thomas Lorenzo-Thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the Mississippi Valley. </entity/>Frederick-Douglass Frederick-Douglass once observed of Lincoln: "In his company, I was never reminded of my humble origin, or of my unpopular color".
Gettysburg Address (1863).
</entity/>
With the great Union victory at the </entity/>Battle-of-Gettysburg Battle-of-Gettysburg in July 1863, and the defeat of the Copperheads in the Ohio election in the fall, Lincoln maintained a strong base of party support and was in a strong position to redefine the war effort, despite the </entity/>New-York-City-draft-riots New-York-City-draft-riots. The stage was set for his address at the Gettysburg battlefield cemetery on November 19, 1863. Defying Lincoln's prediction that "the world will little note, nor long remember what we say here," the Address became the most quoted speech in American history.
In 272 words, and three minutes, Lincoln asserted the nation was born not in 1789, but in 1776, "conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal". He defined the war as an effort dedicated to these principles of liberty and equality for all. The emancipation of slaves was now part of the national war effort. He declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain, that slavery would end as a result of the losses, and the future of democracy in the world would be assured, that "government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth". Lincoln concluded that the Civil War had a profound objective: a new birth of freedom in the nation.
General Grant.
</entity/>
Meade's failure to capture Lee's army as it retreated from Gettysburg, and the continued passivity of the Army of the Potomac, persuaded Lincoln that a change in command was needed. General </entity/>Ulysses-S.-Grant Ulysses-S.-Grant's victories at the </entity/>Battle-of-Shiloh Battle-of-Shiloh and in the </entity/>Vicksburg-campaign Vicksburg-campaign impressed Lincoln and made Grant a strong candidate to head the Union Army. Responding to criticism of Grant after Shiloh, Lincoln had said, "I can't spare this man. He fights." With Grant in command, Lincoln felt the Union Army could relentlessly pursue a series of coordinated offensives in multiple theaters, and have a top commander who agreed on the use of black troops.
Nevertheless, Lincoln was concerned that Grant might be considering a candidacy for President in 1864, as McClellan was. Lincoln arranged for an intermediary to make inquiry into Grant's political intentions, and being assured that he had none, submitted to the Senate Grant's promotion to commander of the Union Army. He obtained Congress's consent to reinstate for Grant the rank of Lieutenant General, which no officer had held since George Washington.
Grant waged his bloody </entity/>Overland-Campaign Overland-Campaign in 1864. This is often characterized as a </entity/>attrition-warfare </mention/>war-of-attrition, given high Union losses at battles such as the </entity/>Battle-of-the-Wilderness Battle-of-the-Wilderness and </entity/>Battle-of-Cold-Harbor </mention/>Cold-Harbor. Even though they had the advantage of fighting on the defensive, the Confederate forces had "almost as high a percentage of casualties as the Union forces". The high casualty figures of the Union alarmed the North; Grant had lost a third of his army, and Lincoln asked what Grant's plans were, to which the general replied, "I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer."
The Confederacy lacked reinforcements, so Lee's army shrank with every costly battle. Grant's army moved south, crossed the </entity/>James-River James-River, forcing a siege and trench warfare outside </entity/>Petersburg,-Virginia Petersburg,-Virginia. Lincoln then made an extended visit to Grant's headquarters at City Point, Virginia. This allowed the president to confer in person with Grant and William Tecumseh Sherman about the hostilities, as Sherman coincidentally managed a hasty visit to Grant from his position in North Carolina. Lincoln and the Republican Party mobilized support for the draft throughout the North, and replaced the Union losses.
Lincoln authorized Grant to target the Confederate infrastructure—such as plantations, railroads, and bridges—hoping to destroy the South's morale and weaken its economic ability to continue fighting. Grant's move to Petersburg resulted in the obstruction of three railroads between Richmond and the South. This strategy allowed Generals Sherman and </entity/>Philip-Sheridan Philip-Sheridan to destroy plantations and towns in Virginia's </entity/>Shenandoah-Valley Shenandoah-Valley. The damage caused by </entity/>Sherman's-March-to-the-Sea Sherman's-March-to-the-Sea through Georgia in 1864 was limited to a swath, but neither Lincoln nor his commanders saw destruction as the main goal, but rather defeat of the Confederate armies. As Neely (2004) concludes, there was no effort to engage in "</entity/>total-war total-war" against civilians, as in World War II.
Confederate general </entity/>Jubal-Anderson-Early Jubal-Anderson-Early began a series of assaults in the North that threatened the Capital. During Early's </entity/>Battle-of-Fort-Stevens </mention/>raid-on-Washington,-D.C. in 1864, Lincoln was watching the combat from an exposed position; Captain </entity/>Oliver-Wendell-Holmes,-Jr. </mention/>Oliver-Wendell-Holmes shouted at him, "Get down, you damn fool, before you get shot!" After repeated calls on Grant to defend Washington, Sheridan was appointed and the threat from Early was dispatched.
As Grant continued to wear down Lee's forces, efforts to discuss peace began. Confederate Vice President </entity/>Alexander-H.-Stephens </mention/>Stephens led a group to meet with Lincoln, Seward, and others at </entity/>Hampton-Roads-Conference </mention/>Hampton-Roads. Lincoln refused to allow any negotiation with the Confederacy as a coequal; his sole objective was an agreement to end the fighting and the meetings produced no results. On April 1, 1865, Grant successfully outflanked Lee's forces in the </entity/>Battle-of-Five-Forks Battle-of-Five-Forks and nearly encircled Petersburg, and the Confederate government evacuated Richmond. Days later, when that city fell, Lincoln visited the vanquished Confederate capital; as he walked through the city, white Southerners were stone-faced, but </entity/>freedmen freedmen greeted him as a hero. On April 9, Lee surrendered to Grant at </entity/>Appomattox-Court-House-National-Historical-Park </mention/>Appomattox and the war was effectively over.
1864 re-election.
While the war was still being waged, Lincoln faced reelection in 1864. Lincoln was a master politician, bringing together—and holding together—all the main factions of the Republican Party, and bringing in </entity/>War-Democrats War-Democrats such as </entity/>Edwin-M.-Stanton Edwin-M.-Stanton and Andrew Johnson as well. Lincoln spent many hours a week talking to politicians from across the land and using his patronage powers—greatly expanded over peacetime—to hold the factions of his party together, build support for his own policies, and fend off efforts by Radicals to drop him from the 1864 ticket. At its 1864 convention, the Republican Party selected Johnson, a War Democrat from the Southern state of Tennessee, as his running mate. To broaden his coalition to include War Democrats as well as Republicans, Lincoln ran under the label of the new </entity/>National-Union-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Union-Party.
When Grant's 1864 spring campaigns turned into bloody stalemates and Union casualties mounted, the lack of military success wore heavily on the President's re-election prospects, and many Republicans across the country feared that Lincoln would be defeated. Sharing this fear, Lincoln wrote and signed a pledge that, if he should lose the election, he would still defeat the Confederacy before turning over the White House:
 Lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet, but asked them to sign the sealed envelope.
While the Democratic platform followed the "Peace wing" of the party and called the war a "failure", their candidate, General George B. McClellan, supported the war and repudiated the platform. Lincoln provided Grant with more troops and mobilized his party to renew its support of Grant in the war effort. Sherman's capture of Atlanta in September and </entity/>David-Farragut David-Farragut's capture of Mobile ended defeatist jitters; the Democratic Party was deeply split, with some leaders and most soldiers openly for Lincoln. By contrast, the National Union Party was united and energized as Lincoln made emancipation the central issue, and state Republican parties stressed the </entity/>perfidy perfidy of the Copperheads. On November 8, Lincoln was re-elected in a landslide, carrying all but three states, and receiving 78 percent of the Union soldiers' vote.
On March 4, 1865, Lincoln delivered his </entity/>Lincoln's-second-inaugural-address </mention/>second-inaugural-address. In it, he deemed the high casualties on both sides to be God's will. Historian </entity/>Mark-Noll Mark-Noll concludes it ranks "among the small handful of semi-sacred texts by which Americans conceive their place in the world". Lincoln said:
Reconstruction.
Reconstruction began during the war, as Lincoln and his associates anticipated questions of how to reintegrate the conquered southern states, and how to determine the fates of Confederate leaders and freed slaves. Shortly after Lee's surrender, a general had asked Lincoln how the defeated Confederates should be treated, and Lincoln replied, "Let 'em up easy." In keeping with that sentiment, Lincoln led the moderates regarding Reconstruction policy, and was opposed by the Radical Republicans, under Rep. </entity/>Thaddeus-Stevens Thaddeus-Stevens, Sen. </entity/>Charles-Sumner Charles-Sumner and Sen. </entity/>Benjamin-Wade Benjamin-Wade, political allies of the president on other issues. Determined to find a course that would reunite the nation and not alienate the South, Lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held throughout the war. His </entity/>Ten-percent-plan </mention/>Amnesty-Proclamation of December 8, 1863, offered pardons to those who had not held a Confederate civil office, had not mistreated Union prisoners, and would sign an oath of allegiance.
</entity/>
As Southern states were subdued, critical decisions had to be made as to their leadership while their administrations were re-formed. Of special importance were Tennessee and Arkansas, where Lincoln appointed Generals </entity/>Andrew-Johnson#General </mention/>Andrew-Johnson and </entity/>Frederick-Steele Frederick-Steele as military governors, respectively. In Louisiana, Lincoln ordered General </entity/>Nathaniel-P.-Banks Nathaniel-P.-Banks to promote a plan that would restore statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed to it. Lincoln's Democratic opponents seized on these appointments to accuse him of using the military to ensure his and the Republicans' political aspirations. On the other hand, the Radicals denounced his policy as too lenient, and passed their own plan, the </entity/>Wade-Davis-Bill Wade-Davis-Bill, in 1864. When Lincoln vetoed the bill, the Radicals retaliated by refusing to seat representatives elected from Louisiana, Arkansas, and Tennessee.
Lincoln's appointments were designed to keep both the moderate and Radical factions in harness. To fill Chief Justice Taney's seat on the Supreme Court, he named the choice of the Radicals, Salmon P. Chase, who Lincoln believed would uphold the emancipation and paper money policies.
After implementing the Emancipation Proclamation, which did not apply to every state, Lincoln increased pressure on Congress to outlaw slavery throughout the entire nation with a constitutional amendment. Lincoln declared that such an amendment would "clinch the whole matter". By December 1863, a proposed constitutional amendment that would outlaw slavery was brought to Congress for passage. This first attempt at an amendment failed to pass, falling short of the required two-thirds majority on June 15, 1864, in the House of Representatives. Passage of the proposed amendment became part of the Republican/Unionist platform in the election of 1864. After a long debate in the House, a second attempt passed Congress on January 31, 1865, and was sent to the state legislatures for ratification. Upon ratification, it became the </entity/>Thirteenth-Amendment-to-the-United-States-Constitution </mention/>Thirteenth-Amendment to the United States Constitution on December 6, 1865.
As the war drew to a close, Lincoln's presidential Reconstruction for the South was in flux; having believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen. He signed into law Senator Charles Sumner's </entity/>Freedmen's-Bureau Freedmen's-Bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate material needs of former slaves. The law assigned land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen. Lincoln stated that his Louisiana plan did not apply to all states under Reconstruction. Shortly before his assassination, Lincoln announced he had a new plan for southern Reconstruction. Discussions with his cabinet revealed Lincoln planned short-term military control over southern states, until readmission under the control of southern Unionists.
Historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly what Lincoln would have done about Reconstruction if he had lived, but they make projections based on his known policy positions and political acumen.
Lincoln biographers </entity/>James-G.-Randall James-G.-Randall and </entity/>Richard-Current Richard-Current, according to David Lincove, argue that:
</entity/>Eric-Foner Eric-Foner argues that:
Redefining the republic and republicanism.
</entity/>
The successful reunification of the states had consequences for the name of the country. The term "the United States" has historically been used, sometimes in the plural ("these United States"), and other times in the singular, without any particular grammatical consistency. The Civil War was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century.
In recent years, historians such as Harry Jaffa, Herman Belz, John Diggins, Vernon Burton and Eric Foner have stressed Lincoln's redefinition of "republican values". As early as the 1850s, a time when most political rhetoric focused on the sanctity of the Constitution, Lincoln redirected emphasis to the Declaration of Independence as the foundation of American political values—what he called the "sheet anchor" of republicanism. The Declaration's emphasis on freedom and equality for all, in contrast to the Constitution's tolerance of slavery, shifted the debate. As Diggins concludes regarding the highly influential Cooper Union speech of early 1860, "Lincoln presented Americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself." His position gained strength because he highlighted the moral basis of republicanism, rather than its legalisms. Nevertheless, in 1861, Lincoln justified the war in terms of legalisms (the Constitution was a contract, and for one party to get out of a contract all the other parties had to agree), and then in terms of the national duty to guarantee a republican form of government in every state. Burton (2008) argues that Lincoln's republicanism was taken up by the Freedmen as they were emancipated.
In March 1861, in </entity/>Lincoln's-first-inaugural-address Lincoln's-first-inaugural-address, he explored the nature of democracy. He denounced secession as anarchy, and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints in the American system. He said "A majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations, and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments, is the only true sovereign of a free people."
Other enactments.
Lincoln adhered to the Whig theory of the presidency, which gave Congress primary responsibility for writing the laws while the Executive enforced them. Lincoln only vetoed four bills passed by Congress; the only important one was the Wade-Davis Bill with its harsh program of Reconstruction. He signed the </entity/>Homestead-Act Homestead-Act in 1862, making millions of acres of government-held land in the West available for purchase at very low cost. The </entity/>Morrill-Land-Grant-Colleges-Act Morrill-Land-Grant-Colleges-Act, also signed in 1862, provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state. The </entity/>Pacific-Railway-Acts Pacific-Railway-Acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the United States' </entity/>First-Transcontinental-Railroad First-Transcontinental-Railroad, which was completed in 1869. The passage of the Homestead Act and the Pacific Railway Acts was made possible by the absence of Southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s.
Other important legislation involved two measures to raise revenues for the Federal government: tariffs (a policy with long precedent), and a new Federal income tax. In 1861, Lincoln signed the second and third </entity/>Morrill-Tariff Morrill-Tariff, the first having become law under James Buchanan. Also in 1861, Lincoln signed the </entity/>Revenue-Act-of-1861 Revenue-Act-of-1861, creating the first U.S. income tax. This created a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above $800 ($ in current dollar terms), which was later changed by the </entity/>Revenue-Act-of-1862 Revenue-Act-of-1862 to a progressive rate structure.
Lincoln also presided over the expansion of the federal government's economic influence in several other areas. The creation of the system of national banks by the </entity/>National-Banking-Act National-Banking-Act provided a strong financial network in the country. It also established a national currency. In 1862, Congress created, with Lincoln's approval, the </entity/>United-States-Department-of-Agriculture </mention/>Department-of-Agriculture. In 1862, Lincoln sent a senior general, John Pope, to put down the "</entity/>Dakota-War-of-1862 </mention/>Sioux-Uprising" in Minnesota. Presented with 303 execution warrants for convicted </entity/>Sioux#Santee-(Isáŋyathi-or-Eastern-Dakota) </mention/>Santee-Dakota who were accused of killing innocent farmers, Lincoln conducted his own personal review of each of these warrants, eventually approving 39 for execution (one was later reprieved). President Lincoln had planned to reform federal Indian policy.
In the wake of Grant's casualties in his campaign against Lee, Lincoln had considered yet another executive call for a military draft, but it was never issued. In response to rumors of one, however, the editors of the "</entity/>New-York-World New-York-World" and the "</entity/>The-Journal-of-Commerce </mention/>Journal-of-Commerce" published a false draft proclamation which created an opportunity for the editors and others employed at the publications to corner the gold market. Lincoln's reaction was to send the strongest of messages to the media about such behavior; he ordered the military to seize the two papers. The seizure lasted for two days.
Lincoln is largely responsible for the institution of the </entity/>Thanksgiving-(United-States) </mention/>Thanksgiving-holiday in the United States. Before Lincoln's presidency, Thanksgiving, while a regional holiday in New England since the 17th century, had been proclaimed by the federal government only sporadically and on irregular dates. The last such proclamation had been during </entity/>James-Madison James-Madison's presidency 50 years before. In 1863, Lincoln declared the final Thursday in November of that year to be a day of Thanksgiving. In June 1864, Lincoln approved the Yosemite Grant enacted by Congress, which provided unprecedented federal protection for the area now known as </entity/>Yosemite-National-Park Yosemite-National-Park.
Judicial appointments.
Supreme Court appointments.
</entity/>
Lincoln's declared philosophy on court nominations was that "we cannot ask a man what he will do, and if we should, and he should answer us, we should despise him for it. Therefore we must take a man whose opinions are known." Lincoln made five appointments to the United States Supreme Court. </entity/>Noah-Haynes-Swayne Noah-Haynes-Swayne, nominated January 21, 1862 and appointed January 24, 1862, was chosen as an anti-slavery lawyer who was committed to the Union. </entity/>Samuel-Freeman-Miller Samuel-Freeman-Miller, nominated and appointed on July 16, 1862, supported Lincoln in the 1860 election and was an avowed abolitionist. David Davis, Lincoln's campaign manager in 1860, nominated December 1, 1862 and appointed December 8, 1862, had also served as a judge in Lincoln's Illinois court circuit. </entity/>Stephen-Johnson-Field Stephen-Johnson-Field, a previous California Supreme Court justice, was nominated March 6, 1863 and appointed March 10, 1863, and provided geographic balance, as well as political balance to the court as a Democrat. Finally, Lincoln's Treasury Secretary, Salmon P. Chase, was nominated as Chief Justice, and appointed the same day, on December 6, 1864. Lincoln believed Chase was an able jurist, would support Reconstruction legislation, and that his appointment united the Republican Party.
Other judicial appointments.
Lincoln appointed 32 federal judges, including four Associate Justices and one Chief Justice to the </entity/>Supreme-Court-of-the-United-States Supreme-Court-of-the-United-States, and 27 judges to the </entity/>United-States-district-courts United-States-district-courts. Lincoln appointed no judges to the </entity/>United-States-circuit-court United-States-circuit-courts during his time in office.
States admitted to the Union.
</entity/>West-Virginia West-Virginia, admitted to the Union June 20, 1863, contained the former north-westernmost counties of Virginia that seceded from Virginia after that commonwealth declared its secession from the Union. As a condition for its admission, West Virginia's constitution was required to provide for the gradual abolition of slavery. </entity/>Nevada Nevada, which became the third State in the far-west of the continent, was admitted as a free state on October 31, 1864.
Assassination.
</entity/>John-Wilkes-Booth John-Wilkes-Booth was a well-known actor and a Confederate spy from Maryland; though he never joined the Confederate army, he had contacts with the Confederate secret service. In 1864, Booth formulated a plan (very similar to one of Thomas N. Conrad previously authorized by the Confederacy) to kidnap Lincoln in exchange for the release of Confederate prisoners. </entity/> After attending an April 11, 1865, speech in which Lincoln promoted voting rights for blacks, an incensed Booth changed his plans and became determined to assassinate the president. Learning that the President, First Lady, and head Union general Ulysses S. Grant would be attending </entity/>Ford's-Theatre Ford's-Theatre, Booth formulated a plan with co-conspirators to assassinate Vice President Andrew Johnson, Secretary of State William H. Seward and General Grant. Without his main bodyguard, </entity/>Ward-Hill-Lamon Ward-Hill-Lamon, Lincoln left to attend the play "</entity/>Our-American-Cousin Our-American-Cousin" on April 14. At the last minute, Grant and his wife chose to travel to New Jersey to visit their children instead of attending the play.
Lincoln's bodyguard, John Parker, left Ford's Theater during intermission to join Lincoln's coachman for drinks in the Star Saloon next door. The now unguarded President sat in his state box in the balcony. Seizing the opportunity, Booth crept up from behind and at about 10:13 pm, aimed at the back of Lincoln's head and fired at point-blank range, mortally wounding the President. Major </entity/>Henry-Rathbone Henry-Rathbone momentarily grappled with Booth, but Booth stabbed him and escaped.
After being on the run for 12 days, Booth was tracked down and found on a farm in Virginia, some south of Washington, D.C. After refusing to surrender to Union troops, Booth was killed by Sergeant </entity/>Boston-Corbett Boston-Corbett on April 26.
An Army surgeon, Doctor </entity/>Charles-Leale Charles-Leale, was sitting nearby at the theater and immediately assisted the President. He found the President unresponsive, barely breathing and with no detectable pulse. Having determined that the President had been shot in the head, and not stabbed in the shoulder as originally thought, he made an attempt to clear the blood clot, after which the President began to breathe more naturally. The dying President was taken across the street to </entity/>Petersen-House Petersen-House. After remaining in a coma for nine hours, Lincoln died at 7:22 am on April 15. Presbyterian minister </entity/>Phineas-Densmore-Gurley Phineas-Densmore-Gurley, then present, was asked to offer a prayer, after which Secretary of War Stanton saluted and said, "Now he belongs to the ages."
Lincoln's flag-enfolded body was then escorted in the rain to the White House by bareheaded Union officers, while the city's church bells rang. President Johnson was sworn in at 10:00 am, less than 3 hours after Lincoln's death. The late President lay in state in the East Room, and then in the Capitol Rotunda from April 19 through April 21. For his final journey with his son Willie, both caskets were transported in the executive coach "United States" and for three weeks the "Lincoln Special" </entity/>Funeral-and-burial-of-Abraham-Lincoln#Funeral-train </mention/>funeral-train decorated in black bunting bore Lincoln's remains on a slow circuitous waypoint journey from Washington D.C. to Springfield, Illinois stopping at many cities across the North for large-scale memorials attended by hundreds of thousands, as well as many people who gathered in informal trackside tributes with bands, bonfires and hymn singing or silent reverence with hat in hand as the railway procession slowly passed by.
Religious and philosophical beliefs.
</entity/>
As a young man, Lincoln was a </entity/>religious-skepticism </mention/>religious-skeptic, or, in the words of a biographer, even an </entity/>iconoclasm </mention/>iconoclast. Later in life, Lincoln's frequent use of religious imagery and language might have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to appeal to his audiences, who were mostly </entity/>Evangelicalism </mention/>evangelical Protestants. He never joined a church, although he frequently attended with his wife. However, he was deeply familiar with the Bible, and he both quoted and praised it. He was private about his beliefs and respected the beliefs of others. Lincoln never made a clear profession of Christian beliefs. However he did believe in an all-powerful God that shaped events and, by 1865, was expressing those beliefs in major speeches.
In the 1840s, Lincoln subscribed to the Doctrine of Necessity, a belief that asserted the human mind was controlled by some higher power. In the 1850s, Lincoln acknowledged "providence" in a general way, and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals; he regarded the republicanism of the Founding Fathers with an almost religious reverence. When he suffered the death of his son Edward, Lincoln more frequently acknowledged his own need to depend on God. The death of his son Willie in February 1862 may have caused Lincoln to look toward religion for answers and solace. After Willie's death, Lincoln considered why, from a divine standpoint, the severity of the war was necessary. He wrote at this time that God "could have either saved or destroyed the Union without a human contest. Yet the contest began. And having begun He could give the final victory to either side any day. Yet the contest proceeds." On the day Lincoln was assassinated, he reportedly told his wife he desired to visit the </entity/>Holy-Land Holy-Land.
Health.
Several claims abound that Lincoln's health was declining before the assassination. These are often based on photographs appearing to show weight loss and muscle wasting. One such claim is that he suffered from a rare genetic disorder </entity/>Multiple-endocrine-neoplasia-type-2b </mention/>MEN2b, which manifests with a </entity/>medullary-thyroid-carcinoma medullary-thyroid-carcinoma, </entity/>Mucosal-neuromata-with-endocrine-tumors </mention/>mucosal-neuromas and a </entity/>Marfanoid </mention/>Marfinoid-appearance. Others simply claim he had </entity/>Marfan's-syndrome Marfan's-syndrome, based on his tall appearance with spindly fingers, and the association of possible </entity/>aortic-regurgitation aortic-regurgitation, which can cause bobbing of the head (</entity/>De-Musset's-sign </mention/>DeMusset's-sign) based on blurring of Lincoln's head in photographs, which back then had a long exposure time.
DNA analysis is so far being refused by the Grand Army of the Republic museum in Philadelphia.
Historical reputation.
In </entity/>Historical-rankings-of-Presidents-of-the-United-States </mention/>surveys-of-scholars-ranking-Presidents since the 1940s, Lincoln is consistently ranked in the top three, often #1. A 2004 study found that scholars in the fields of history and politics ranked Lincoln number one, while legal scholars placed him second after Washington. Of all the presidential ranking polls conducted since 1948, Lincoln has been rated at the very top in the majority of polls: Schlesinger 1948, Schlesinger 1962, 1982 Murray Blessing Survey, "Chicago Tribune" 1982 poll, Schlesinger 1996, CSPAN 1996, Ridings-McIver 1996, "Time" 2008, and CSPAN 2009. Generally, the top three presidents are rated as 1. Lincoln; 2. George Washington; and 3. Franklin D. Roosevelt, although Lincoln and Washington, and Washington and Roosevelt, occasionally are reversed.
President Lincoln's assassination made him a national martyr and endowed him with a recognition of mythic proportion. Lincoln was viewed by abolitionists as a champion for human liberty. Republicans linked Lincoln's name to their party. Many, though not all, in the South considered Lincoln as a man of outstanding ability.

Schwartz argues that Lincoln's reputation grew slowly in the late 19th century until the </entity/>Progressive-Era Progressive-Era (1900–1920s) when he emerged as one of the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the </entity/>Lincoln-Memorial Lincoln-Memorial on the Mall in Washington. In the </entity/>New-Deal New-Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who doubtless would have supported the welfare state. In the </entity/>Cold-War Cold-War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.
By the 1970s Lincoln had become a hero to </entity/>Conservatism-in-the-United-States </mention/>political-conservatives for his intense nationalism, support for business, his insistence on stopping the spread of human bondage, his acting in terms of </entity/>John-Locke </mention/>Lockean and </entity/>Edmund-Burke </mention/>Burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition, and his devotion to the principles of the Founding Fathers. As a Whig activist, Lincoln was a spokesman for business interests, favoring high tariffs, banks, internal improvements, and railroads in opposition to the </entity/>Jacksonian-Democracy </mention/>agrarian-Democrats. William C. Harris found that Lincoln's "reverence for the Founding Fathers, the Constitution, the laws under it, and the preservation of the Republic and its institutions undergirded and strengthened his conservatism". James G. Randall emphasizes his tolerance and especially his moderation "in his preference for orderly progress, his distrust of dangerous agitation, and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform". Randall concludes that, "he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of so-called 'radicalism' which involved abuse of the South, hatred for the slaveholder, thirst for vengeance, partisan plotting, and ungenerous demands that Southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders."
By the late 1960s, liberals, such as historian </entity/>Lerone-Bennett,-Jr. </mention/>Lerone-Bennett, were having second thoughts, especially regarding Lincoln's views on racial issues. Bennett won wide attention when he called Lincoln a white supremacist in 1968. He noted that Lincoln used ethnic slurs, told jokes that ridiculed blacks, insisted he opposed social equality, and proposed </entity/>American-Colonization-Society </mention/>sending-freed-slaves to another country. Defenders, such as authors Dirck and Cashin, retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day; and that he was a "moral visionary" who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause, as fast as politically possible. The emphasis shifted away from Lincoln-the-emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery, or at least were responsible for pressuring the government on emancipation. Historian Barry Schwartz wrote in 2009 that Lincoln's image suffered "erosion, fading prestige, benign ridicule" in the late 20th century. On the other hand, Donald opined in his 1996 biography that Lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of </entity/>negative-capability negative-capability, defined by the poet </entity/>John-Keats John-Keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were "content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts, and not compelled toward fact or reason".
Lincoln has often been portrayed by Hollywood, almost always in a flattering light.
Memorials.
</entity/>
Lincoln's portrait appears on two denominations of </entity/>United-States-currency United-States-currency, the </entity/>Penny-(United-States-coin) </mention/>penny and the </entity/>United-States-five-dollar-bill </mention/>$5-bill. His likeness also appears on many </entity/>U.S.-presidents-on-U.S.-postage-stamps#Abraham-Lincoln </mention/>postage-stamps and has been memorialized in many town, city, and county names, including the </entity/>Lincoln,-Nebraska </mention/>capital of Nebraska.
The most famous and most visited memorials are the Lincoln Memorial in Washington, D.C.; Lincoln's sculpture on </entity/>Mount-Rushmore Mount-Rushmore; </entity/>Ford's-Theatre Ford's-Theatre and </entity/>Petersen-House Petersen-House (where he died) in Washington and the </entity/>Abraham-Lincoln-Presidential-Library-and-Museum Abraham-Lincoln-Presidential-Library-and-Museum, located in Springfield, Illinois, not far from </entity/>Lincoln-Home-National-Historic-Site </mention/>Lincoln's-home and </entity/>Lincoln's-Tomb </mention/>his-tomb.
Barry Schwartz, a sociologist who has examined America's cultural memory, argues that in the 1930s and 1940s, the memory of Abraham Lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with "a moral symbol inspiring and guiding American life". During the Great Depression, he argues, Lincoln served "as a means for seeing the world's disappointments, for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful". Franklin D. Roosevelt, preparing America for war, used the words of the Civil War president to clarify the threat posed by Germany and Japan. Americans asked, "What would Lincoln do?" However, he also finds that since World War II, Lincoln's symbolic power has lost relevance, and this "fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness". He suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept.

Aristotle

Aristotle (; , "Aristotélēs"; 384) was a </entity/>Greeks </mention/>Greek </entity/>philosopher philosopher and scientist born in the </entity/>Macedonia-(ancient-kingdom) </mention/>Macedonian city of </entity/>Stagirus Stagirus, in . His father, </entity/>Nicomachus-(father-of-Aristotle) </mention/>Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter </entity/>Proxenus-of-Atarneus Proxenus-of-Atarneus became his guardian. At eighteen, he joined </entity/>Plato's-Academy Plato's-Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (</entity/>Circa </mention/>c. ). His writings cover many subjectsand constitute the first comprehensive system of </entity/>Western-philosophy Western-philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of </entity/>Philip-of-Macedon Philip-of-Macedon, tutored </entity/>Alexander-the-Great Alexander-the-Great between 356 and . According to the </entity/>Encyclopædia-Britannica Encyclopædia-Britannica, "Aristotle was the first genuine scientist in history ... [and] every scientist is in his debt."
Teaching Alexander the Great gave Aristotle many opportunities and an abundance of supplies. He established a library in the </entity/>Lyceum Lyceum which aided in the production of many of his hundreds of books. The fact that Aristotle was a pupil of Plato contributed to his former views of </entity/>Platonism Platonism, but, following Plato's death, Aristotle immersed himself in empirical studies and shifted from Platonism to </entity/>empiricism empiricism. He believed all peoples' concepts and all of their knowledge was ultimately based on </entity/>perception perception. Aristotle's views on </entity/>natural-science natural-sciences represent the groundwork underlying many of his works.
Aristotle's views on </entity/>Aristotelian-physics </mention/>physical-science profoundly shaped medieval scholarship. Their influence extended into the </entity/>Renaissance Renaissance and were not replaced systematically until </entity/>Age-of-Enlightenment </mention/>the-Enlightenment and theories such as </entity/>classical-mechanics classical-mechanics. Some of Aristotle's zoological observations were not confirmed or refuted until the 19th century. His works contain the earliest known formal study of logic, which was incorporated in the late 19th century into modern </entity/>formal-logic formal-logic.
In metaphysics, </entity/>Aristotelianism Aristotelianism profoundly influenced </entity/>Judeo-Islamic-philosophies-(800–1400) </mention/>Judeo-Islamic-philosophical-and-theological-thought during the </entity/>Middle-Ages Middle-Ages and continues to influence </entity/>Christian-theology Christian-theology, especially the </entity/>Scholasticism </mention/>scholastic tradition of the </entity/>Catholic-Church Catholic-Church. Aristotle was well known among medieval Muslim intellectuals and revered as "The First Teacher" ().
His ethics, though always influential, gained renewed interest with the modern advent of </entity/>virtue-ethics virtue-ethics. All aspects of Aristotle's philosophy continue to be the object of active academic study today. Though Aristotle wrote many elegant treatises and dialoguesit is thought that only around a third of his original output has survived.
Life.
Aristotle, whose name means "the best purpose", was born in in </entity/>Stagira-(ancient-city) </mention/>Stagira, </entity/>Chalcidice Chalcidice, about 55 km (34 miles) east of modern-day </entity/>Thessaloniki Thessaloniki. His father </entity/>Nicomachus-(father-of-Aristotle) </mention/>Nicomachus was the personal physician to </entity/>Amyntas-III-of-Macedon </mention/>King-Amyntas-of </entity/>Macedon Macedon. Although there is little information on Aristotle's childhood, he probably spent some time within the Macedonian palace, making his first connections with the Macedonian monarchy.
At about the age of eighteen, Aristotle moved to </entity/>Athens Athens to continue his education at </entity/>Platonic-Academy </mention/>Plato's-Academy. He remained there for nearly twenty years before leaving Athens in . The traditional story about his departure records that he was disappointed with the Academy's direction after control passed to Plato's nephew </entity/>Speusippus Speusippus, although it is possible that he feared anti-Macedonian sentiments and left before Plato had died. Aristotle and Plato's compatibility has been a strongly debated topic. Recently, </entity/>Harold-Cherniss Harold-Cherniss summarized Aristotle's Platonism from the standpoint of </entity/>Classics </mention/>classicist </entity/>Werner-Jaeger Werner-Jaeger, stating that: "Jaeger, in whose eyes Plato's philosophy was the "matter" out of which the newer and higher form of Aristotle's thought proceeded by a gradual but steady and undeviating development ("Aristotles", ), pronounced the "old controversy", whether or not Aristotle understood Plato, to be "absolut verstandnislos". Yet this did not prevent Leisegang from reasserting that Aristotle's own pattern of thinking was incompatible with a proper understanding of Plato." Contrary to Leisegang's sympathies, Jaeger was sympathetic to a compatible reading of Aristotle and Plato.
Aristotle then accompanied </entity/>Xenocrates Xenocrates to the court of his friend </entity/>Hermias-of-Atarneus Hermias-of-Atarneus in </entity/>Asia-Minor Asia-Minor. There, he traveled with </entity/>Theophrastus Theophrastus to the island of </entity/>Lesbos Lesbos, where together they researched the </entity/>botany botany and zoology of the island. Aristotle married </entity/>Pythias Pythias, either Hermias's adoptive daughter or niece. She bore him a daughter, whom they also named Pythias. Soon after Hermias' death, Aristotle was invited by </entity/>Philip-II-of-Macedon Philip-II-of-Macedon to become the tutor to his son </entity/>Alexander-the-Great </mention/>Alexander in .
</entity/>
Aristotle was appointed as the head of the royal academy of </entity/>Macedon Macedon. During that time he gave lessons not only to Alexander, but also to two other future kings: </entity/>Ptolemy-I-Soter </mention/>Ptolemy and </entity/>Cassander Cassander. Aristotle encouraged Alexander toward eastern conquest and his attitude towards </entity/>Persia Persia was unabashedly </entity/>Ethnocentricism </mention/>ethnocentric. In one famous example, he counsels Alexander to be "a leader to the Greeks and a despot to the barbarians, to look after the former as after friends and relatives, and to deal with the latter as with beasts or plants".
By , Artistotle had returned to Athens, establishing his own school there known as the </entity/>Lyceum-(Classical) </mention/>Lyceum. Aristotle conducted courses at the school for the next twelve years. While in Athens, his wife Pythias died and Aristotle became involved with </entity/>Herpyllis Herpyllis of Stagira, who bore him a son whom he named after his father, </entity/>Nicomachus-(son-of-Aristotle) </mention/>Nicomachus. According to the </entity/>Suda Suda, he also had an </entity/>eromenos eromenos, </entity/>Palaephatus </mention/>Palaephatus-of-Abydus.
This period in Athens, between 335 and , is when Aristotle is believed to have composed many of his works. He wrote many dialogues of which only fragments have survived. Those works that have survived are in </entity/>treatise treatise form and were not, for the most part, intended for widespread publication; they are generally thought to be lecture aids for his students. His most important treatises include "</entity/>Physics-(Aristotle) </mention/>Physics", "</entity/>Metaphysics-(Aristotle) </mention/>Metaphysics", "</entity/>Nicomachean-Ethics Nicomachean-Ethics", "</entity/>Politics-(Aristotle) </mention/>Politics", "</entity/>De-Anima De-Anima" ("On the Soul") and "</entity/>Poetics-(Aristotle) </mention/>Poetics".
Aristotle not only studied almost every subject possible at the time, but made significant contributions to most of them. In physical science, Aristotle studied anatomy, astronomy, </entity/>embryology embryology, geography, geology, meteorology, physics and zoology. In philosophy, he wrote on aesthetics, ethics, government, metaphysics, politics, economics, psychology, rhetoric and theology. He also studied education, foreign customs, literature and poetry. His combined works constitute a virtual encyclopedia of Greek knowledge.
Near the end of his life, Alexander and Aristotle became estranged over Alexander's relationship with Persia and Persians. A widespread tradition in antiquity suspected Aristotle of playing a role in Alexander's death, but there is little evidence.
Following Alexander's death, anti-Macedonian sentiment in Athens was rekindled. In , </entity/>Eurymedon-the-Hierophant Eurymedon-the-Hierophant denounced Aristotle for not holding the gods in honor, prompting him to flee to his mother's family estate in </entity/>Chalcis Chalcis, explaining: "I will not allow the Athenians to sin twice against philosophy"a reference to Athens's prior </entity/>Trial-of-Socrates </mention/>trial-and-execution-of-Socrates. He died in Euboea of </entity/>natural-causes natural-causes later that same year, having named his student </entity/>Antipater Antipater as his chief </entity/>executor executor and leaving a </entity/>Will-(law) </mention/>will in which he asked to be buried next to his wife.
Charles Walston argues that the tomb of Aristotle is located on the sacred way between Chalcis and Eretria and to have contained two styluses, a pen, a signet-ring and some terra-cottas as well as what is supposed to be the earthly remains of Aristotle in the form of some skull fragments.
In general, the details of the life of Aristotle are not well-established. The biographies of Aristotle written in ancient times are often speculative and historians only agree on a few salient points.
Thought.
Logic.
</entity/>
With the "</entity/>Prior-Analytics Prior-Analytics", Aristotle is credited with the earliest study of formal logic, and his conception of it was the dominant form of Western logic until 19th century advances in </entity/>mathematical-logic mathematical-logic. </entity/>Immanuel-Kant </mention/>Kant stated in the "Critique of Pure Reason" that Aristotle's theory of logic completely accounted for the core of </entity/>deductive-inference deductive-inference.
History.
Aristotle "says that 'on the subject of reasoning' he 'had nothing else on an earlier date to speak of'". However, Plato reports that </entity/>syntax syntax was devised before him, by </entity/>Prodicus-of-Ceos Prodicus-of-Ceos, who was concerned by the correct use of words. Logic seems to have emerged from </entity/>dialectics dialectics; the earlier philosophers made frequent use of concepts like "</entity/>reductio-ad-absurdum reductio-ad-absurdum" in their discussions, but never truly understood the logical implications. Even Plato had difficulties with logic; although he had a reasonable conception of a </entity/>deductive-system deductive-system, he could never actually construct one, thus he relied instead on his </entity/>dialectic dialectic.
Plato believed that deduction would simply follow from </entity/>premise premises, hence he focused on maintaining solid premises so that the </entity/>Logical-consequence </mention/>conclusion would logically follow. Consequently, Plato realized that a method for obtaining conclusions would be most beneficial. He never succeeded in devising such a method, but his best attempt was published in his book "</entity/>Sophist-(dialogue) </mention/>Sophist", where he introduced his division method.
Analytics and the "Organon".
What we today call "Aristotelian logic", Aristotle himself would have labeled "analytics". The term "logic" he reserved to mean "dialectics". Most of Aristotle's work is probably not in its original form, because it was most likely edited by students and later lecturers. The logical works of Aristotle were compiled into six books in about the early 1st century CE:
The order of the books (or the teachings from which they are composed) is not certain, but this list was derived from analysis of Aristotle's writings. It goes from the basics, the analysis of simple terms in the "Categories," the analysis of propositions and their elementary relations in "On Interpretation", to the study of more complex forms, namely, syllogisms (in the "Analytics") and dialectics (in the "Topics" and "Sophistical Refutations"). The first three treatises form the core of the logical theory "stricto sensu": the grammar of the language of logic and the correct rules of reasoning. There is one volume of Aristotle's concerning logic not found in the "Organon", namely the fourth book of "Metaphysics."
Aristotle's epistemology.
</entity/>
</entity/>
Like his teacher Plato, Aristotle's philosophy aims at the </entity/>Universality-(philosophy) </mention/>universal. Aristotle's </entity/>ontology ontology, however, finds the universal in </entity/>particular particular things, which he calls the essence of things, while in Plato's ontology, the universal exists apart from particular things, and is related to them as their </entity/>prototype prototype or </entity/>wikt:exemplar </mention/>exemplar. For Aristotle, therefore, </entity/>epistemology epistemology is based on the study of particular phenomena and rises to the knowledge of essences, while for Plato epistemology begins with knowledge of universal </entity/>Theory-of-Forms </mention/>Forms (or ideas) and descends to knowledge of particular imitations of these. For Aristotle, "form" still refers to the unconditional basis of </entity/>phenomena phenomena but is "instantiated" in a particular substance (see "</entity/>Aristotle#Universals-and-particulars </mention/>Universals-and-particulars", below). In a certain sense, Aristotle's method is both </entity/>Inductive-reasoning </mention/>inductive and </entity/>Deductive-reasoning </mention/>deductive, while Plato's is essentially deductive from "</entity/>A-priori-and-a-posteriori </mention/>a-priori" principles.
In Aristotle's terminology, "natural philosophy" is a branch of philosophy examining the phenomena of the natural world, and includes fields that would be regarded today as physics, biology and other natural sciences. In modern times, the scope of "philosophy" has become limited to more generic or abstract inquiries, such as ethics and metaphysics, in which logic plays a major role. Today's philosophy tends to exclude empirical study of the natural world by means of the scientific method. In contrast, Aristotle's philosophical endeavors encompassed virtually all facets of intellectual inquiry.
In the larger sense of the word, Aristotle makes philosophy coextensive with reasoning, which he also would describe as "science". Note, however, that his use of the term "science" carries a different meaning than that covered by the term "scientific method". For Aristotle, "all science ("dianoia") is either practical, poetical or theoretical" ("Metaphysics" 1025b25). By practical science, he means ethics and politics; by poetical science, he means the study of poetry and the other fine arts; by theoretical science, he means physics, mathematics and metaphysics.
If logic (or "analytics") is regarded as a study preliminary to philosophy, the divisions of Aristotelian philosophy would consist of: (1) </entity/>Logic Logic; (2) Theoretical Philosophy, including Metaphysics, Physics and Mathematics; (3) Practical Philosophy and (4) Poetical Philosophy.
In the period between his two stays in Athens, between his times at the Academy and the Lyceum, Aristotle conducted most of the scientific thinking and research for which he is renowned today. In fact, most of Aristotle's life was devoted to the study of the objects of natural science. Aristotle's metaphysics contains observations on the nature of numbers but he made no original contributions to mathematics. He did, however, perform </entity/>original-research original-research in the natural sciences, e.g., botany, zoology, physics, astronomy, chemistry, meteorology, and several other sciences.
Aristotle's writings on science are largely qualitative, as opposed to quantitative. Beginning in the 16th century, scientists began applying mathematics to the physical sciences, and Aristotle's work in this area was deemed hopelessly inadequate. His failings were largely due to the absence of concepts like mass, velocity, force and temperature. He had a conception of speed and temperature, but no quantitative understanding of them, which was partly due to the absence of basic experimental devices, like clocks and thermometers.
His writings provide an account of many scientific observations, a mixture of precocious accuracy and curious errors. For example, in his "</entity/>History-of-Animals History-of-Animals" he claimed that human males have more teeth than females. In a similar vein, </entity/>John-Philoponus John-Philoponus, and later </entity/>Galileo-Galilei </mention/>Galileo, showed by simple experiments that Aristotle's theory that a heavier object falls faster than a lighter object is incorrect. On the other hand, Aristotle refuted </entity/>Democritus Democritus's claim that the </entity/>Milky-Way Milky-Way was made up of "those stars which are shaded by the earth from the sun's rays," pointing out (correctly, even if such reasoning was bound to be dismissed for a long time) that, given "current astronomical demonstrations" that "the size of the sun is greater than that of the earth and the distance of the stars from the earth many times greater than that of the sun, then ... the sun shines on all the stars and the earth screens none of them."
In places, Aristotle goes too far in deriving 'laws of the universe' from simple observation and over-stretched </entity/>reason reason. Today's scientific method assumes that such thinking without sufficient facts is ineffective, and that discerning the validity of one's hypothesis requires far more rigorous experimentation than that which Aristotle used to support his laws.
Aristotle also had some scientific blind spots. He posited a </entity/>geocentrism </mention/>geocentric-cosmology that we may discern in selections of the "Metaphysics", which was widely accepted up until the 16th century. From the 3rd century to the 16th century, the dominant view held that the Earth was the rotational </entity/>History-of-the-Center-of-the-Universe </mention/>center-of-the-universe.
Because he was perhaps the philosopher most respected by European thinkers during and after the Renaissance, these thinkers often took Aristotle's erroneous positions as given, which held back science in this epoch. However, Aristotle's scientific shortcomings should not mislead one into forgetting his great advances in the many scientific fields. For instance, he founded logic as a formal science and created foundations to biology that were not superseded for two millennia. Moreover, he introduced the fundamental notion that nature is composed of things that change and that studying such changes can provide useful knowledge of underlying constants.
Geology.
As quoted from </entity/>w:Charles-Lyell </mention/>Charles-Lyell's "</entity/>Principles-of-Geology Principles-of-Geology":
He [Aristotle] refers to many examples of changes now constantly going on, and insists emphatically on the great results which they must produce in the lapse of ages. He instances particular cases of lakes that had dried up, and deserts that had at length become watered by rivers and fertilized. He points to the growth of the Nilotic delta since the time of Homer, to the shallowing of the </entity/>Palus-Maeotis Palus-Maeotis within sixty years from his own time ... He alludes ... to the upheaving of one of the Eolian islands, previous to a volcanic eruption. The changes of the earth, he says, are so slow in comparison to the duration of our lives, that they are overlooked; and the migrations of people after great catastrophes, and their removal to other regions, cause the event to be forgotten.
He says [12th chapter of his "Meteorics"] 'the distribution of land and sea in particular regions does not endure throughout all time, but it becomes sea in those parts where it was land, and again it becomes land where it was sea, and there is reason for thinking that these changes take place according to a certain system, and within a certain period.' The concluding observation is as follows: 'As time never fails, and the universe is eternal, neither the Tanais, nor the Nile, can have flowed for ever. The places where they rise were once dry, and there is a limit to their operations, but there is none to time. So also of all other rivers; they spring up and they perish; and the sea also continually deserts some lands and invades others The same tracts, therefore, of the earth are not some always sea, and others always continents, but every thing changes in the course of time.'
Physics.
Five elements.
Aristotle proposed a fifth element, aether, in addition to the four proposed earlier by </entity/>Empedocles Empedocles.
Each of the four earthly elements has its natural place. All that is earthly tends toward the center of the universe, i.e., the center of the Earth. Water tends toward a sphere surrounding the center. Air tends toward a sphere surrounding the water sphere. Fire tends toward the lunar sphere (in which the Moon orbits). When elements are moved out of their natural place, they naturally move back towards it. This is "natural motion"—motion requiring no extrinsic cause. So, for example, in water, earthy bodies sink while air bubbles rise up; in air, rain falls and flame rises. Outside all the other spheres, the heavenly, fifth element, manifested in the stars and planets, moves in the perfection of circles.
Motion.
Aristotle defined </entity/>Motion-(physics) </mention/>motion as the actuality of a potentiality "as such". Aquinas suggested that the passage be understood literally; that motion can indeed be understood as the active fulfillment of a potential, as a transition toward a potentially possible state. Because </entity/>Aristotle#Substance,-potentiality-and-actuality </mention/>actuality-and-potentiality are normally opposites in Aristotle, other commentators either suggest that the wording which has come down to us is erroneous, or that the addition of the "as such" to the definition is critical to understanding it.
Causality, the four causes.
Aristotle suggested that the reason for anything coming about can be attributed to four different types of simultaneously active causal factors:
Additionally, things can be causes of one another, causing each other reciprocally, as hard work causes fitness and vice versa, although not in the same way or function, the one is as the beginning of change, the other as the goal. (Thus Aristotle first suggested a reciprocal or circular causality as a relation of mutual dependence or influence of cause upon effect). Moreover, Aristotle indicated that the same thing can be the cause of contrary effects; its presence and absence may result in different outcomes. Simply it is the goal or purpose that brings about an event. Our two dominoes require someone or something to intentionally knock over the first domino, because it cannot fall of its own accord.
Aristotle marked two modes of causation: proper (prior) causation and accidental (chance) causation. All causes, proper and incidental, can be spoken as potential or as actual, particular or generic. The same language refers to the effects of causes, so that generic effects assigned to generic causes, particular effects to particular causes, operating causes to actual effects. Essentially, causality does not suggest a temporal relation between the cause and the effect.
Optics.
Aristotle held more accurate theories on some optical concepts than other philosophers of his day. The second oldest written evidence of a </entity/>camera-obscura camera-obscura (after </entity/>Mozi Mozi c. 400 BC) can be found in Aristotle's documentation of such a device in 350 BC in "Problemata". Aristotle's apparatus contained a dark chamber that had a single small hole, or </entity/>aperture aperture, to allow for sunlight to enter. Aristotle used the device to make observations of the sun and noted that no matter what shape the hole was, the sun would still be correctly displayed as a round object. In modern cameras, this is analogous to the </entity/>Diaphragm-(optics) </mention/>diaphragm. Aristotle also made the observation that when the distance between the aperture and the surface with the image increased, the image was magnified.
Chance and spontaneity.
According to Aristotle, spontaneity and chance are causes of some things, distinguishable from other types of cause. Chance as an incidental cause lies in the realm of </entity/>sumbebekos </mention/>accidental-things. It is "from what is spontaneous" (but note that what is spontaneous does not come from chance). For a better understanding of Aristotle's conception of "chance" it might be better to think of "coincidence": Something takes place by chance if a person sets out with the intent of having one thing take place, but with the result of another thing (not intended) taking place.
For example: A person seeks donations. That person may find another person willing to donate a substantial sum. However, if the person seeking the donations met the person donating, not for the purpose of collecting donations, but for some other purpose, Aristotle would call the collecting of the donation by that particular donator a result of chance. It must be unusual that something happens by chance. In other words, if something happens all or most of the time, we cannot say that it is by chance.
There is also more specific kind of chance, which Aristotle names "luck", that can only apply to human beings, because it is in the sphere of moral actions. According to Aristotle, luck must involve choice (and thus deliberation), and only humans are capable of deliberation and choice. "What is not capable of action cannot do anything by chance".
Metaphysics.
</entity/>
Aristotle defines metaphysics as "the knowledge of </entity/>hylomorphism </mention/>immaterial being," or of "being in the highest degree of </entity/>abstraction abstraction." He refers to metaphysics as "first philosophy", as well as "the theologic science."
Substance, potentiality and actuality.
Aristotle examines the concepts of </entity/>Substance-theory </mention/>substance and </entity/>essence essence ("ousia") in his "Metaphysics" (Book VII), and he concludes that a particular substance is a combination of both matter and form. In book VIII, he distinguishes the matter of the substance as the </entity/>Material-substratum </mention/>substratum, or the stuff of which it is composed. For example, the matter of a house is the bricks, stones, timbers etc., or whatever constitutes the "potential" house, while the form of the substance is the "actual" house, namely 'covering for bodies and chattels' or any other </entity/>Genus-differentia-definition </mention/>differentia (see also </entity/>predicables predicables) that let us define something as a house. The formula that gives the components is the account of the matter, and the formula that gives the differentia is the account of the form.
With regard to the change ("</entity/>Potentiality-and-actuality </mention/>kinesis") and its causes now, as he defines in his </entity/>Physics-(Aristotle) </mention/>Physics and </entity/>On-Generation-and-Corruption On-Generation-and-Corruption 319b–320a, he distinguishes the coming to be from:
The coming to be is a change where nothing persists of which the resultant is a property. In that particular change he introduces the concept of potentiality ("</entity/>Dunamis </mention/>dynamis") and actuality ("</entity/>entelecheia entelecheia") in association with the matter and the form.
Referring to potentiality, this is what a thing is capable of doing, or being acted upon, if the conditions are right and it is not prevented by something else. For example, the seed of a plant in the soil is potentially ("dynamei") plant, and if is not prevented by something, it will become a plant. Potentially beings can either 'act' ("poiein") or 'be acted upon' ("paschein"), which can be either innate or learned. For example, the eyes possess the potentiality of sight (innate – being acted upon), while the capability of playing the flute can be possessed by learning (exercise – acting).
Actuality is the fulfillment of the end of the potentiality. Because the end ("telos") is the principle of every change, and for the sake of the end exists potentiality, therefore actuality is the end. Referring then to our previous example, we could say that an actuality is when a plant does one of the activities that plants do.
"For that for the sake of which a thing is, is its principle, and the becoming is for the sake of the end; and the actuality is the end, and it is for the sake of this that the potentiality is acquired. For animals do not see in order that they may have sight, but they have sight that they may see."
In summary, the matter used to make a house has potentiality to be a house and both the activity of building and the form of the final house are actualities, which is also a </entity/>final-cause final-cause or end. Then Aristotle proceeds and concludes that the actuality is prior to potentiality in formula, in time and in substantiality.
With this </entity/>definition definition of the particular substance (i.e., matter and form), Aristotle tries to solve the problem of the unity of the beings, for example, "what is it that makes a man one"? Since, according to Plato there are two Ideas: animal and biped, how then is man a unity? However, according to Aristotle, the potential being (matter) and the actual one (form) are one and the same thing.
Universals and particulars.
Aristotle's predecessor, Plato, argued that all things have a universal form, which could be either a property, or a relation to other things. When we look at an apple, for example, we see an apple, and we can also analyze a form of an apple. In this distinction, there is a particular apple and a universal form of an apple. Moreover, we can place an apple next to a book, so that we can speak of both the book and apple as being next to each other.
Plato argued that there are some universal forms that are not a part of particular things. For example, it is possible that there is no particular good in existence, but "good" is still a proper universal form. </entity/>Bertrand-Russell Bertrand-Russell is a 20th-century philosopher who agreed with Plato on the existence of "uninstantiated universals".
Aristotle disagreed with Plato on this point, arguing that all universals are instantiated. Aristotle argued that there are no universals that are unattached to existing things. According to Aristotle, if a universal exists, either as a particular or a relation, then there must have been, must be currently, or must be in the future, something on which the universal can be predicated. Consequently, according to Aristotle, if it is not the case that some universal can be predicated to an object that exists at some period of time, then it does not exist.
In addition, Aristotle disagreed with Plato about the location of universals. As Plato spoke of the world of the forms, a location where all universal forms subsist, Aristotle maintained that universals exist within each thing on which each universal is predicated. So, according to Aristotle, the form of apple exists within each apple, rather than in the world of the forms.
Biology and medicine.
In Aristotelian science, especially in biology, things he saw himself have stood the test of time better than his retelling of the reports of others, which contain error and superstition. He dissected animals but not humans; his ideas on how the human body works have been almost entirely superseded.
Empirical research program.
</entity/>
</entity/>
</entity/>
Aristotle is the earliest natural historian whose work has survived in some detail. Aristotle certainly did research on the natural history of </entity/>Lesbos Lesbos, and the surrounding seas and neighbouring areas. The works that reflect this research, such as "</entity/>History-of-Animals History-of-Animals", "</entity/>Generation-of-Animals Generation-of-Animals", and "</entity/>Parts-of-Animals Parts-of-Animals", contain some observations and interpretations, along with sundry myths and mistakes. The most striking passages are about the sea-life visible from observation on Lesbos and available from the catches of fishermen. His observations on </entity/>catfish catfish, </entity/>Electric-ray </mention/>electric-fish ("</entity/>Torpedo-(genus) </mention/>Torpedo") and angler-fish are detailed, as is his writing on </entity/>cephalopod cephalopods, namely, "Octopus", "Sepia" (</entity/>cuttlefish cuttlefish) and the paper nautilus ("</entity/>Argonauta-argo Argonauta-argo"). His description of the </entity/>hectocotylus </mention/>hectocotyl-arm, used in sexual reproduction, was widely disbelieved until its rediscovery in the 19th century. He separated the aquatic mammals from fish, and knew that sharks and rays were part of the group he called Selachē (</entity/>selachians selachians).
Another good example of his methods comes from the "Generation of Animals" in which Aristotle describes breaking open fertilized chicken eggs at intervals to observe when visible organs were generated.
He gave accurate descriptions of </entity/>ruminant ruminants' four-chambered fore-stomachs, and of the </entity/>Ovoviviparity </mention/>ovoviviparous embryological development of the </entity/>hound-shark hound-shark "</entity/>Mustelus-mustelus Mustelus-mustelus".
Classification of living things.
Aristotle's classification of living things contains some elements which still existed in the 19th century. What the modern zoologist would call vertebrates and invertebrates, Aristotle called 'animals with blood' and 'animals without blood' (he did not know that complex invertebrates do make use of </entity/>hemoglobin hemoglobin, but of a different kind from vertebrates). Animals with blood were divided into live-bearing (humans and mammals), and egg-bearing (birds and fish). Invertebrates ('animals without blood') are insects, crustacea (divided into non-shelled – cephalopods – and shelled) and testacea (molluscs). In some respects, this incomplete classification is better than that of </entity/>Linnaeus Linnaeus, who crowded the invertebrata together into two groups, Insecta and Vermes (worms).
For </entity/>Charles-Singer Charles-Singer, "Nothing is more remarkable than [Aristotle's] efforts to [exhibit] the relationships of living things as a "scala naturae"" Aristotle's "History of Animals" classified organisms in relation to a hierarchical "</entity/>Great-chain-of-being </mention/>Ladder-of-Life" ("scala naturae" or </entity/>Great-Chain-of-Being Great-Chain-of-Being), placing them according to complexity of structure and function so that higher organisms showed greater vitality and ability to move.
Aristotle believed that intellectual purposes, i.e., </entity/>final-cause final-causes, guided all natural processes. Such a </entity/>teleological teleological view gave Aristotle cause to justify his observed data as an expression of formal design. Noting that "no animal has, at the same time, both tusks and horns," and "a single-hooved animal with two horns I have never seen," Aristotle suggested that Nature, giving no animal both horns and tusks, was staving off vanity, and giving creatures faculties only to such a degree as they are necessary. Noting that ruminants had multiple stomachs and weak teeth, he supposed the first was to compensate for the latter, with Nature trying to preserve a type of balance.
In a similar fashion, Aristotle believed that creatures were arranged in a graded scale of perfection rising from plants on up to man, the "scala naturae". His system had eleven grades, arranged according "to the degree to which they are infected with potentiality", expressed in their form at birth. The highest animals laid warm and wet creatures alive, the lowest bore theirs cold, dry, and in thick eggs.
Aristotle also held that the level of a creature's perfection was reflected in its form, but not preordained by that form. Ideas like this, and his ideas about souls, are not regarded as science at all in modern times.
He placed emphasis on the type(s) of soul an organism possessed, asserting that plants possess a vegetative soul, responsible for reproduction and growth, animals a vegetative and a sensitive soul, responsible for mobility and sensation, and humans a vegetative, a sensitive, and a rational soul, capable of thought and reflection.
Aristotle, in contrast to earlier philosophers, but in accordance with the Egyptians, placed the rational soul in the heart, rather than the brain. Notable is Aristotle's division of sensation and thought, which generally went against previous philosophers, with the exception of </entity/>Alcmaeon-of-Croton </mention/>Alcmaeon.
Successor: Theophrastus.
</entity/>
Aristotle's successor at the </entity/>Lyceum-(Classical) </mention/>Lyceum, </entity/>Theophrastus Theophrastus, wrote a series of books on botany—the "History of Plants"—which survived as the most important contribution of antiquity to botany, even into the </entity/>Middle-Ages Middle-Ages. Many of Theophrastus' names survive into modern times, such as "carpos" for fruit, and "pericarpion" for seed vessel.
Rather than focus on formal causes, as Aristotle did, Theophrastus suggested a mechanistic scheme, drawing analogies between natural and artificial processes, and relying on Aristotle's concept of the </entity/>efficient-cause efficient-cause. Theophrastus also recognized the role of sex in the reproduction of some higher plants, though this last discovery was lost in later ages.
Influence on Hellenistic medicine.
After Theophrastus, the Lyceum failed to produce any original work. Though interest in Aristotle's ideas survived, they were generally taken unquestioningly. It is not until the age of </entity/>Alexandria Alexandria under the </entity/>Ptolemaic-dynasty </mention/>Ptolemies that advances in biology can be again found.
The first medical teacher at Alexandria, </entity/>Herophilos </mention/>Herophilus-of-Chalcedon, corrected Aristotle, placing intelligence in the brain, and connected the nervous system to motion and sensation. Herophilus also distinguished between </entity/>vein veins and </entity/>artery </mention/>arteries, noting that the latter </entity/>pulse pulse while the former do not. Though a few ancient </entity/>atomism </mention/>atomists such as </entity/>Lucretius Lucretius challenged the </entity/>teleology </mention/>teleological viewpoint of Aristotelian ideas about life, teleology (and after the rise of Christianity, </entity/>natural-theology natural-theology) would remain central to biological thought essentially until the 18th and 19th centuries. </entity/>Ernst-Mayr Ernst-Mayr claimed that there was "nothing of any real consequence in biology after Lucretius and Galen until the Renaissance." Aristotle's ideas of natural history and medicine survived, but they were generally taken unquestioningly.
Psychology.
Aristotle's </entity/>psychology psychology, given in his treatise </entity/>On-the-Soul On-the-Soul ("peri psyche", often known by its </entity/>Latin Latin title "De Anima"), posits three kinds of </entity/>soul soul ("psyches"): the vegetative soul, the sensitive soul, and the rational soul. Humans have a rational soul. This kind of soul is capable of the same powers as the other kinds: Like the vegetative soul it can grow and nourish itself; like the sensitive soul it can experience sensations and move locally. The unique part of the human, rational soul is its ability to receive forms of other things and compare them.
For Aristotle, the soul ("psyche") was a simpler concept than it is for us today. By soul he simply meant the </entity/>Hylomorphism#Body–soul-hylomorphism </mention/>form of a living being. Because all beings are composites of form and matter, the form of living beings is that which endows them with what is specific to living beings, e.g. the ability to initiate movement (or in the case of plants, growth and chemical transformations, which Aristotle considers types of movement).
Memory.
According to Aristotle, </entity/>memory memory is the ability to hold a perceived experience in your mind and to have the ability to distinguish between the internal "appearance" and an occurrence in the past. In other words, a memory is a mental picture (</entity/>wikt:phantasm </mention/>phantasm) in which Aristotle defines in "De Anima", as an appearance which is imprinted on the part of the body that forms a memory. Aristotle believed an "imprint" becomes impressed on a semi-fluid bodily organ that undergoes several changes in order to make a memory. A memory occurs when a </entity/>stimulus-(psychology) </mention/>stimuli is too complex that the nervous system (semi-fluid bodily organ) cannot receive all the impressions at once. These changes are the same as those involved in the operations of </entity/>sense </mention/>sensation, </entity/>common-sense common-sense, and </entity/>thinking thinking . The mental picture imprinted on the bodily organ is the final product of the entire process of sense perception. It does not matter if the experience was seen or heard, every experience ends up as a mental image in memory
Aristotle uses the word "memory" for two basic abilities. First, the actual retaining of the experience in the </entity/>mnemonic mnemonic "imprint" that can develop from sensation. Second, the intellectual anxiety that comes with the "imprint" due to being impressed at a particular time and processing specific contents. These abilities can be explained as memory is neither sensation nor thinking because is arises only after a lapse of time. Therefore, memory is of the past, prediction is of the future, and sensation is of the present. The retrieval of our "imprints" cannot be performed suddenly. A transitional channel is needed and located in our past experiences, both for our previous experience and present experience.
Aristotle proposed that slow-witted people have good memory because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences and so the "imprint" can easily continue. However, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new "imprints". He believed the young and the old do not properly develop an "imprint". Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderly's organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new "imprints". Likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ. Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have </entity/>perception perception of time.
Recollection.
Because Aristotle believes people receive all kinds of sense perceptions and people perceive them as images or "imprints", people are continually weaving together new "imprints" of things they experience. In order to search for these "imprints", people search the memory itself. Within the memory, if one </entity/>experience experience is offered instead of a specific memory, that person will reject this experience until they find what they are looking for. </entity/>Recall-(memory) </mention/>Recollection occurs when one experience naturally follows another. If the chain of "images" is needed, one memory will stimulate the other. If the chain of "images" is not needed, but expected, then it will only stimulate the other memory in most instances. When people recall experiences, they stimulate certain previous experiences until they have stimulated the one that was needed .
Recollection is the self-directed activity of retrieving the information stored in a memory "imprint" after some time has passed. Retrieval of stored information is dependent on the scope of mnemonic capabilities of a being (human or animal) and the abilities the human or animal possesses . Only humans will remember "imprints" of intellectual activity, such as numbers and words. Animals that have perception of time will be able to retrieve memories of their past observations. Remembering involves only perception of the things remembered and of the time passed. Recollection of an "imprint" is when the present experiences a person remembers are similar with elements corresponding in character and arrangement of past sensory experiences. When an "imprint" is recalled, it may bring forth a large group of related "imprints" .
Aristotle believed the chain of thought, which ends in recollection of certain "imprints", was connected systematically in three sorts of relationships: similarity, contrast, and contiguity. These three laws make up his </entity/>Laws-of-Association Laws-of-Association. Aristotle believed that past experiences are hidden within our mind. A force operates to awaken the hidden material to bring up the actual experience. According to Aristotle, association is the power innate in a mental state, which operates upon the unexpressed remains of former experiences, allowing them to rise and be recalled .
Practical philosophy.
Ethics.
Aristotle considered ethics to be a practical rather than theoretical study, i.e., one aimed at becoming good and doing good rather than knowing for its own sake. He wrote several treatises on ethics, including most notably, the "</entity/>Nicomachean-Ethics Nicomachean-Ethics".
Aristotle taught that virtue has to do with the proper function ("ergon") of a thing. An eye is only a good eye in so much as it can see, because the proper function of an eye is sight. Aristotle reasoned that humans must have a function specific to humans, and that this function must be an activity of the "</entity/>De-Anima </mention/>psuchē" (normally translated as "soul") in accordance with reason ("</entity/>logos logos"). Aristotle identified such an optimum activity of the soul as the aim of all human deliberate action, "</entity/>eudaimonia eudaimonia", generally translated as "happiness" or sometimes "well being". To have the potential of ever being happy in this way necessarily requires a good character ("ēthikē" "</entity/>aretē aretē"), often translated as moral (or ethical) virtue (or excellence).
Aristotle taught that to achieve a virtuous and potentially happy character requires a first stage of having the fortune to be habituated not deliberately, but by teachers, and experience, leading to a later stage in which one consciously chooses to do the best things. When the best people come to live life this way their practical wisdom ("</entity/>phronesis phronesis") and their intellect ("</entity/>nous nous") can develop with each other towards the highest possible human virtue, the wisdom of an accomplished </entity/>theory </mention/>theoretical or speculative thinker, or in other words, a philosopher.
Politics.
In addition to his works on ethics, which address the individual, Aristotle addressed the city in his work titled "</entity/>Politics-(Aristotle) </mention/>Politics". Aristotle considered the city to be a natural community. Moreover, he considered the city to be prior in importance to the family which in turn is prior to the individual, "for the whole must of necessity be prior to the part". He also famously stated that "man is by nature a political animal". Aristotle conceived of politics as being like an </entity/>organism organism rather than like a machine, and as a collection of parts none of which can exist without the others. Aristotle's conception of the city is organic, and he is considered one of the first to conceive of the city in this manner.
The common modern understanding of a political community as a modern state is quite different from Aristotle's understanding. Although he was aware of the existence and potential of larger empires, the natural community according to Aristotle was the city ("</entity/>polis polis") which functions as a political "community" or "partnership" ("koinōnia"). The aim of the city is not just to avoid injustice or for economic stability, but rather to allow at least some citizens the possibility to live a good life, and to perform beautiful acts: "The political partnership must be regarded, therefore, as being for the sake of noble actions, not for the sake of living together." This is distinguished from modern approaches, beginning with </entity/>social-contract social-contract theory, according to which individuals leave the </entity/>state-of-nature state-of-nature because of "fear of violent death" or its "inconveniences."
Rhetoric and poetics.
Aristotle considered </entity/>epic-poetry epic-poetry, tragedy, comedy, </entity/>Dithyramb </mention/>dithyrambic-poetry and music to be </entity/>Mimesis </mention/>imitative, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner. For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation – through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama. Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.
While it is believed that Aristotle's "Poetics" comprised two books – one on comedy and one on tragedy – only the portion that focuses on tragedy has survived. Aristotle taught that tragedy is composed of six elements: plot-structure, character, style, thought, spectacle, and lyric poetry. The characters in a tragedy are merely a means of driving the story; and the plot, not the characters, is the chief focus of tragedy. Tragedy is the imitation of action arousing pity and fear, and is meant to effect the </entity/>catharsis catharsis of those same emotions. Aristotle concludes "Poetics" with a discussion on which, if either, is superior: epic or tragic </entity/>mimesis mimesis. He suggests that because tragedy possesses all the attributes of an epic, possibly possesses additional attributes such as spectacle and music, is more unified, and achieves the aim of its mimesis in shorter scope, it can be considered superior to epic.
Aristotle was a keen systematic collector of riddles, folklore, and proverbs; he and his school had a special interest in the riddles of the </entity/>Pythia </mention/>Delphic-Oracle and studied the fables of </entity/>Aesop Aesop.
Views on women.
Aristotle's analysis of procreation describes an active, ensouling masculine element bringing life to an inert, passive female element. On this ground, </entity/>feminist-metaphysics feminist-metaphysics have accused Aristotle of </entity/>misogyny misogyny and </entity/>sexism sexism. However, Aristotle gave equal weight to women's happiness as he did to men's, and commented in his "Rhetoric" that a society cannot be happy unless women are happy too.
Loss and preservation of his works.
Modern scholarship reveals that Aristotle's "lost" works stray considerably in characterization from the surviving Aristotelian corpus. Whereas the lost works appear to have been originally written with an intent for subsequent publication, the surviving works do not appear to have been so. Rather the surviving works mostly resemble lecture notes unintended for publication. The authenticity of a portion of the surviving works as originally Aristotelian is also today held suspect, with some books duplicating or summarizing each other, the authorship of one book questioned and another book considered to be unlikely Aristotle's at all.
Some of the individual works within the corpus, including the "</entity/>Constitution-of-Athens Constitution-of-Athens," are regarded by most scholars as products of Aristotle's "school," perhaps compiled under his direction or supervision. Others, such as "</entity/>On-Colors On-Colors," may have been produced by Aristotle's successors at the Lyceum, e.g., </entity/>Theophrastus Theophrastus and </entity/>Strato-of-Lampsacus </mention/>Straton. Still others acquired Aristotle's name through similarities in doctrine or content, such as the "De Plantis," possibly by </entity/>Nicolaus-of-Damascus Nicolaus-of-Damascus. Other works in the corpus include medieval palmistries and </entity/>astrological astrological and </entity/>magic-(paranormal) </mention/>magical texts whose connections to Aristotle are purely fanciful and self-promotional.
According to a distinction that originates with Aristotle himself, his writings are divisible into two groups: the "</entity/>exoteric exoteric" and the "</entity/>esoteric esoteric". Most scholars have understood this as a distinction between works Aristotle intended for the public (exoteric), and the more technical works intended for use within the school (esoteric). Modern scholars commonly assume these latter to be Aristotle's own (unpolished) lecture notes (or in some cases possible notes by his students). However, one classic scholar offers an alternative interpretation. The 5th century </entity/>neoplatonist neoplatonist </entity/>Ammonius-Hermiae Ammonius-Hermiae writes that Aristotle's writing style is deliberately </entity/>Obscurantism </mention/>obscurantist so that "good people may for that reason stretch their mind even more, whereas empty minds that are lost through carelessness will be put to flight by the obscurity when they encounter sentences like these."
Another common assumption is that none of the exoteric works is extant – that all of Aristotle's extant writings are of the esoteric kind. Current knowledge of what exactly the exoteric writings were like is scant and dubious, though many of them may have been in dialogue form. ("Fragments" of some of Aristotle's dialogues have survived.) Perhaps it is to these that </entity/>Cicero Cicero refers when he characterized Aristotle's writing style as "a river of gold"; it is hard for many modern readers to accept that one could seriously so admire the style of those works currently available to us. However, some modern scholars have warned that we cannot know for certain that Cicero's praise was reserved specifically for the exoteric works; a few modern scholars have actually admired the concise writing style found in Aristotle's extant works.
One major question in the history of Aristotle's works, then, is how were the exoteric writings all lost, and how did the ones we now possess come to us The story of the original manuscripts of the esoteric treatises is described by </entity/>Strabo Strabo in his "Geography" and </entity/>Plutarch Plutarch in his "</entity/>Parallel-Lives Parallel-Lives". The manuscripts were left from Aristotle to his successor Theophrastus, who in turn willed them to </entity/>Neleus-of-Scepsis Neleus-of-Scepsis. Neleus supposedly took the writings from Athens to </entity/>Scepsis Scepsis, where his heirs let them languish in a cellar until the 1st century BC, when </entity/>Apellicon-of-Teos Apellicon-of-Teos discovered and purchased the manuscripts, bringing them back to Athens. According to the story, Apellicon tried to repair some of the damage that was done during the manuscripts' stay in the basement, introducing a number of errors into the text. When </entity/>Lucius-Cornelius-Sulla Lucius-Cornelius-Sulla occupied Athens in 86 BC, he carried off the library of Apellicon to Rome, where they were first published in 60 BC by the grammarian </entity/>Tyrannion-of-Amisus Tyrannion-of-Amisus and then by the philosopher </entity/>Andronicus-of-Rhodes Andronicus-of-Rhodes.
Carnes Lord attributes the popular belief in this story to the fact that it provides "the most plausible explanation for the rapid eclipse of the Peripatetic school after the middle of the third century, and for the absence of widespread knowledge of the specialized treatises of Aristotle throughout the Hellenistic period, as well as for the sudden reappearance of a flourishing Aristotelianism during the first century B.C." Lord voices a number of reservations concerning this story, however. First, the condition of the texts is far too good for them to have suffered considerable damage followed by Apellicon's inexpert attempt at repair.
Second, there is "incontrovertible evidence," Lord says, that the treatises were in circulation during the time in which Strabo and Plutarch suggest they were confined within the cellar in Scepsis. Third, the definitive edition of Aristotle's texts seems to have been made in Athens some fifty years before Andronicus supposedly compiled his. And fourth, ancient library catalogues predating Andronicus' intervention list an Aristotelian corpus quite similar to the one we currently possess. Lord sees a number of post-Aristotelian interpolations in the "</entity/>Politics-(Aristotle) </mention/>Politics", for example, but is generally confident that the work has come down to us relatively intact.
On the one hand, the surviving texts of Aristotle do not derive from finished literary texts, but rather from working drafts used within Aristotle's school, as opposed, on the other hand, to the </entity/>Corpus-Aristotelicum#Fragments </mention/>dialogues-and-other-"exoteric"-texts which Aristotle published more widely during his lifetime. The consensus is that Andronicus of Rhodes collected the esoteric works of Aristotle's school which existed in the form of smaller, separate works, distinguished them from those of Theophrastus and other Peripatetics, edited them, and finally compiled them into the more cohesive, larger works as they are known today.
Legacy.
</entity/>
More than 2300 years after his death, Aristotle remains one of the most influential people who ever lived. He contributed to almost every field of human knowledge then in existence, and he was the founder of many new fields. According to the philosopher </entity/>Bryan-Magee Bryan-Magee, "it is doubtful whether any human being has ever known as much as he did". Among countless other achievements, Aristotle was the founder of </entity/>formal-logic formal-logic, pioneered the study of </entity/>zoology zoology, and left every future scientist and philosopher in his debt through his contributions to the scientific method.
Despite these achievements, the influence of Aristotle's errors is considered by some to have held back science considerably. </entity/>Bertrand-Russell Bertrand-Russell notes that "almost every serious intellectual advance has had to begin with an attack on some Aristotelian doctrine". Russell also refers to Aristotle's ethics as "repulsive", and calls his logic "as definitely antiquated as Ptolemaic astronomy". Russell notes that these errors make it difficult to do historical justice to Aristotle, until one remembers how large of an advance he made upon all of his predecessors.
Later Greek philosophers.
The immediate influence of Aristotle's work was felt as the Lyceum grew into the </entity/>Peripatetic-school Peripatetic-school. Aristotle's notable students included </entity/>Aristoxenus Aristoxenus, </entity/>Dicaearchus Dicaearchus, </entity/>Demetrius-of-Phalerum Demetrius-of-Phalerum, </entity/>Eudemos-of-Rhodes Eudemos-of-Rhodes, </entity/>Harpalus Harpalus, </entity/>Hephaestion Hephaestion, </entity/>Meno Meno, </entity/>Mnason-of-Phocis Mnason-of-Phocis, </entity/>Nicomachus-(son-of-Aristotle) </mention/>Nicomachus, and </entity/>Theophrastus Theophrastus. Aristotle's influence over Alexander the Great is seen in the latter's bringing with him on his expedition a host of zoologists, botanists, and researchers. He had also learned a great deal about Persian customs and traditions from his teacher. Although his respect for Aristotle was diminished as his travels made it clear that much of Aristotle's geography was clearly wrong, when the old philosopher released his works to the public, Alexander complained "Thou hast not done well to publish thy acroamatic doctrines; for in what shall I surpass other men if those doctrines wherein I have been trained are to be all men's common property?"
Influence on Byzantine scholars.
Greek Christian scribes played a crucial role in the preservation of Aristotle by copying all the extant Greek language manuscripts of the corpus. The first Greek Christians to comment extensively on Aristotle were </entity/>John-Philoponus John-Philoponus, Elias, and David in the sixth century, and </entity/>Stephen-of-Alexandria Stephen-of-Alexandria in the early seventh century. </entity/>John-Philoponus John-Philoponus stands out for having attempted a fundamental critique of Aristotle's views on the eternity of the world, movement, and other elements of Aristotelian thought. After a hiatus of several centuries, formal commentary by Eustratius and </entity/>Michael-of-Ephesus Michael-of-Ephesus reappears in the late eleventh and early twelfth centuries, apparently sponsored by </entity/>Anna-Comnena Anna-Comnena.
Influence on Islamic theologians.
Aristotle was one of the most revered Western thinkers in early </entity/>Islamic-theology Islamic-theology. Most of the still extant works of Aristotle, as well as a number of the original Greek commentaries, were translated into Arabic and studied by </entity/>Muslim Muslim philosophers, scientists and scholars. </entity/>Averroes Averroes, </entity/>Avicenna Avicenna and </entity/>Alpharabius Alpharabius, who wrote on Aristotle in great depth, also influenced </entity/>Thomas-Aquinas Thomas-Aquinas and other Western Christian scholastic philosophers. </entity/>Alkindus Alkindus considered Aristotle as the outstanding and unique representative of philosophy and Averroes spoke of Aristotle as the "exemplar" for all future philosophers. Medieval Muslim scholars regularly described Aristotle as the "First Teacher". The title "teacher" was first given to Aristotle by Muslim scholars, and was later used by Western philosophers (as in the famous poem of Dante) who were influenced by the tradition of </entity/>Islamic-philosophy Islamic-philosophy.
In accordance with the </entity/>Greeks </mention/>Greek theorists, the Muslims considered Aristotle to be a dogmatic philosopher, the author of a closed system, and believed that Aristotle shared with </entity/>Plato Plato essential tenets of thought. Some went so far as to credit Aristotle himself with neo-Platonic metaphysical ideas.
Influence on Western Christian theologians.
With the loss of the study of ancient Greek in the early medieval Latin West, Aristotle was practically unknown there from c. CE 600 to c. 1100 except through the Latin translation of the "Organon" made by </entity/>Boethius Boethius. In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, interest in Aristotle revived and Latin Christians had translations made, both from Arabic translations, such as those by </entity/>Gerard-of-Cremona Gerard-of-Cremona, and from the original Greek, such as those by </entity/>James-of-Venice James-of-Venice and </entity/>William-of-Moerbeke William-of-Moerbeke.
After </entity/>Thomas-Aquinas Thomas-Aquinas wrote his theology, working from Moerbeke's translations, the demand for Aristotle's writings grew and the </entity/>Greek-language </mention/>Greek manuscripts returned to the West, stimulating a revival of Aristotelianism in Europe that continued into the </entity/>Renaissance Renaissance.
Aristotle is referred to as "The Philosopher" by </entity/>Scholasticism </mention/>Scholastic thinkers such as </entity/>Thomas-Aquinas Thomas-Aquinas. See "</entity/>Summa-Theologica Summa-Theologica", Part I, Question 3, etc. These thinkers blended Aristotelian philosophy with Christianity, bringing the thought of Ancient Greece into the Middle Ages. It required a repudiation of some Aristotelian principles for the sciences and the arts to free themselves for the discovery of modern scientific laws and empirical methods. The medieval English poet </entity/>Geoffrey-Chaucer </mention/>Chaucer describes his student as being happy by having
The Italian poet </entity/>Dante-Alighieri </mention/>Dante says of Aristotle in </entity/>The-Divine-Comedy </mention/>the-first-circles-of-hell,
Post-Enlightenment thinkers.
The German philosopher </entity/>Friedrich-Nietzsche Friedrich-Nietzsche has been said to have taken nearly all of his political philosophy from Aristotle. However implausible this is, it is certainly the case that Aristotle's rigid separation of action from production, and his justification of the subservience of </entity/>slavery </mention/>slaves and others to the virtue – or "arete" – of a few justified the ideal of aristocracy. It is </entity/>Martin-Heidegger Martin-Heidegger, not Nietzsche, who elaborated a new interpretation of Aristotle, intended to warrant his deconstruction of scholastic and philosophical tradition. </entity/>Ayn-Rand Ayn-Rand accredited Aristotle as "the greatest philosopher in history" and cited him as a major influence on her thinking. More recently, </entity/>Alasdair-MacIntyre Alasdair-MacIntyre has attempted to reform what he calls the Aristotelian tradition in a way that is anti-elitist and capable of disputing the claims of both liberals and Nietzscheans.
List of works.
The works of Aristotle that have survived from antiquity through medieval manuscript transmission are collected in the Corpus Aristotelicum. These texts, as opposed to Aristotle's lost works, are technical philosophical treatises from within Aristotle's school. Reference to them is made according to the organization of </entity/>Immanuel-Bekker Immanuel-Bekker's Royal Prussian Academy edition ("Aristotelis Opera edidit Academia Regia Borussica", Berlin, 1831–1870), which in turn is based on ancient classifications of these works.
Eponym.
</entity/>
The </entity/>Aristotle-Mountains Aristotle-Mountains along the </entity/>Oscar-II-Coast Oscar-II-Coast of </entity/>Graham-Land Graham-Land, </entity/>Antarctica Antarctica, are named after Aristotle. He was the first person known to conjecture the existence of a landmass in the southern high-latitude region and call it "Antarctica".

An American in Paris

An American in Paris is a </entity/>symphonic-poem symphonic-poem by the American composer </entity/>George-Gershwin George-Gershwin, written in 1928. Inspired by the time Gershwin had spent in </entity/>Paris Paris, it evokes the sights and energy of the French capital in the 1920s and is one of his best-known compositions.
Gershwin composed "An American in Paris" on commission from the conductor </entity/>Walter-Damrosch Walter-Damrosch. He scored the piece for the standard instruments of the </entity/>symphony-orchestra symphony-orchestra plus </entity/>celesta celesta, </entity/>saxophone saxophones, and automobile horns. He brought back some Parisian taxi horns for the </entity/>New-York-City </mention/>New-York premiere of the composition, which took place on December 13, 1928 in </entity/>Carnegie-Hall Carnegie-Hall, with Damrosch conducting the </entity/>New-York-Philharmonic New-York-Philharmonic. Gershwin completed the orchestration on November 18, less than four weeks before the work's premiere.
Gershwin collaborated on the original program notes with the critic and composer </entity/>Deems-Taylor Deems-Taylor, noting that: "My purpose here is to portray the impression of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city and listens to various street noises and absorbs the French atmosphere." When the tone poem moves into the </entity/>blues blues, "our American friend ... has succumbed to a spasm of </entity/>homesickness homesickness." But, "nostalgia is not a fatal disease." The American visitor "once again is an alert spectator of Parisian life" and "the street noises and French atmosphere are triumphant."
Background.
</entity/>Maurice-Ravel Maurice-Ravel met Gershwin in New York during Ravel's tour of the United States. In that meeting, Gershwin asked Ravel to be his teacher, to which Ravel responded that it was better to be a first-rate Gershwin than a second-rate Ravel. Instead, Ravel recommended that Gershwin see </entity/>Nadia-Boulanger Nadia-Boulanger in Paris. Ravel's high praise of Gershwin in an introductory letter to Boulanger caused Gershwin to seriously consider taking time to study abroad in Paris.
Gershwin arrived in Paris in March 1928. Paris at this time hosted many expatriate writers: among them </entity/>Ezra-Pound Ezra-Pound, </entity/>W.-B.-Yeats W.-B.-Yeats, </entity/>Ernest-Hemingway Ernest-Hemingway; and artist </entity/>Pablo-Picasso Pablo-Picasso. Gershwin met with Boulanger and at her request he played ten minutes of his music. Boulanger replied that she had nothing to teach him. This did not set Gershwin back, as his real intent abroad was to complete a new work based on Paris and perhaps a second rhapsody for piano and orchestra to follow his "</entity/>Rhapsody-in-Blue Rhapsody-in-Blue".
Composition.
Gershwin based "An American in Paris" on a melodic fragment called "Very Parisienne", written in 1926 on his first visit to Paris as a gift to his hosts, Robert and Mabel Schirmer. He described the piece as a "rhapsodic ballet" because it was written freely and is more modern than his previous works. Gershwin explained in "</entity/>Musical-America Musical-America", "My purpose here is to portray the impressions of an American visitor in Paris as he strolls about the city, listens to the various street noises, and absorbs the French atmosphere."
The piece is structured into five sections, which culminate in a loose </entity/>Ternary-form </mention/>ABA-format. Gershwin's first A episode introduces the two main "walking" themes in the "Allegretto grazioso" and develops a third theme in the "Subito con brio". The style of this A section is written in the typical French style of composers </entity/>Claude-Debussy Claude-Debussy and </entity/>Les-Six Les-Six. This A section featured duple meter, singsong rhythms, and diatonic melodies with the sounds of oboe, English horn, and taxi horns. The B section's "Andante ma con ritmo deciso" introduces the American </entity/>Blues Blues and spasms of homesickness. The "Allegro" that follows continues to express homesickness in a faster </entity/>twelve-bar-blues twelve-bar-blues. In the B section, Gershwin uses common time, syncopated rhythms, and bluesy melodies with the sounds of trumpet, saxophone, and snare drum. "Moderato con grazia" is the last A section that returns to the themes set in A. After recapitulating the "walking" themes, Gershwin overlays the slow blues theme from section B in the final “Grandioso.”
Instrumentation.
"An American in Paris" is scored for 3 </entity/>flute flutes (3rd doubling on </entity/>piccolo piccolo), 2 </entity/>oboe oboes, </entity/>English-horn English-horn, 2 </entity/>clarinet clarinets in </entity/>soprano-clarinet </mention/>B-flat, </entity/>bass-clarinet bass-clarinet in B flat, 2 </entity/>bassoon bassoons, 4 </entity/>Horn-(instrument) </mention/>horns in F, 3 </entity/>trumpet trumpets in B flat, 3 </entity/>trombone trombones, </entity/>tuba tuba, </entity/>timpani timpani, </entity/>snare-drum snare-drum, </entity/>bass-drum bass-drum, </entity/>Triangle-(instrument) </mention/>triangle, </entity/>wood-block wood-block, </entity/>cymbal cymbals, low and high </entity/>Tom-tom-drum </mention/>tom-toms, </entity/>xylophone xylophone, </entity/>glockenspiel glockenspiel, </entity/>celesta celesta, 4 </entity/>vehicle-horn </mention/>taxi-horns labeled as A, B, C and D, </entity/>alto-saxophone alto-saxophone/</entity/>soprano-saxophone soprano-saxophone, </entity/>tenor-saxophone tenor-saxophone/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, </entity/>baritone-saxophone baritone-saxophone/soprano saxophone/alto saxophone, and </entity/>String-section </mention/>strings.
The revised edition by F. Campbell-Watson calls for three saxophones, alto, tenor and baritone. In this arrangement the soprano and alto doublings have been rewritten to avoid changing instruments.
</entity/>William-Merrigan-Daly </mention/>William-Daly arranged the score for piano solo which was published by New World Music in 1929.
Response.
Gershwin did not particularly like Walter Damrosch's interpretation at the world premiere of "An American in Paris". He stated that Damrosch's sluggish, dragging tempo caused him to walk out of the hall during a matinee performance of this work. The audience, according to Edward Cushing, responded with "a demonstration of enthusiasm impressively genuine in contrast to the conventional applause which new music, good and bad, ordinarily arouses." Critics believed that "An American in Paris" was better crafted than his lukewarm </entity/>Concerto-in-F-(Gershwin) </mention/>Concerto-in-F. Some did not think it belonged in a program with classical composers </entity/>César-Franck César-Franck, </entity/>Richard-Wagner Richard-Wagner, or </entity/>Guillaume-Lekeu Guillaume-Lekeu on its premiere. Gershwin responded to the critics, "It's not a Beethoven Symphony, you know... It's a humorous piece, nothing solemn about it. It's not intended to draw tears. If it pleases symphony audiences as a light, jolly piece, a series of impressions musically expressed, it succeeds."
Preservation status.
On September 22, 2013, it was announced that a musicological </entity/>Historical-editions-(music) </mention/>critical-edition of the full orchestral score will be eventually released. The Gershwin family, working in conjunction with the </entity/>Library-of-Congress Library-of-Congress and the </entity/>University-of-Michigan University-of-Michigan, are working to make scores available to the public that represent Gershwin's true intent. It is unknown if the critical score will include the material Gershwin later deleted from the work (such as the restatement of the blues theme after the faster 12 bar blues section), or if the score will document changes in the orchestration during Gershwin's composition process. 
The score to "An American in Paris" is currently scheduled to be issued first in a series of scores to be released. The project may take 30 to 40 years to complete. The first edition will probably be published by 2023. 
Recordings.
</entity/>
"An American in Paris" has been frequently recorded. The first recording was made for </entity/>RCA-Victor RCA-Victor in 1929 with </entity/>Nathaniel-Shilkret Nathaniel-Shilkret conducting the Victor Symphony Orchestra, drawn from members of the </entity/>Philadelphia-Orchestra Philadelphia-Orchestra. Gershwin was on hand to "supervise" the recording; however, Shilkret was reported to be in charge and eventually asked the composer to leave the recording studio. Then, a little later, Shilkret discovered there was no one to play the brief </entity/>celesta celesta solo during the slow section, so he hastily asked Gershwin if he might play the solo; Gershwin said he could and so he briefly participated in the actual recording. The radio broadcast of the September 8, 1937 Hollywood Bowl George Gershwin Memorial Concert, in which "An American in Paris," also conducted by Shilkret, was second on the program, was recorded and was released in 1998 in a two-CD set. </entity/>Arthur-Fiedler Arthur-Fiedler and the </entity/>Boston-Pops-Orchestra Boston-Pops-Orchestra recorded the work for RCA Victor, including one of the first stereo recordings of the music. In 1945, </entity/>Arturo-Toscanini Arturo-Toscanini and the </entity/>NBC-Symphony-Orchestra NBC-Symphony-Orchestra recorded the music in </entity/>Carnegie-Hall Carnegie-Hall, one of the few commercial recordings Toscanini made of music by an American composer. The </entity/>Seattle-Symphony Seattle-Symphony also recorded a version in the 1980s of Gershwin's original score, before he made numerous edits resulting in the score as we hear it today.
Use in film.
In 1951, MGM released the musical "</entity/>An-American-in-Paris-(film) </mention/>An-American-in-Paris", featuring </entity/>Gene-Kelly Gene-Kelly and </entity/>Leslie-Caron Leslie-Caron. Winning the 1951 Best Picture Oscar and numerous other awards, the film was directed by </entity/>Vincente-Minnelli Vincente-Minnelli, featured many tunes of Gershwin, and concluded with an extensive, elaborate dance sequence built around the "An American in Paris" symphonic poem (arranged for the film by </entity/>Johnny-Green Johnny-Green), costing $500,000.
A part of the symphonic composition is also featured in "</entity/>As-Good-as-It-Gets As-Good-as-It-Gets", released in 1997.

Academy Awards

The Academy Awards, commonly known as The Oscars, (rebranded as The Oscars in 2013) is an annual American awards ceremony honoring cinematic achievements in the </entity/>film-industry film-industry. Winners are awarded the statuette, officially the Academy Award of Merit, that is much better known by its nickname Oscar. The awards, first presented in 1929 at the </entity/>Hollywood-Roosevelt-Hotel Hollywood-Roosevelt-Hotel, are overseen by the </entity/>Academy-of-Motion-Picture-Arts-and-Sciences Academy-of-Motion-Picture-Arts-and-Sciences (AMPAS). 
The awards ceremony was first televised in 1953 and is now seen live in more than 200 countries. The Oscars is also the oldest entertainment awards ceremony; its equivalents, the </entity/>Emmy-Awards Emmy-Awards for television, the </entity/>Tony-Awards Tony-Awards for theatre, and the </entity/>Grammy-Awards Grammy-Awards for music and recording, are modeled after the Academy Awards. 
The </entity/>86th-Academy-Awards 86th-Academy-Awards ceremony was held on March 2, 2014, at the </entity/>Dolby-Theatre Dolby-Theatre in Los Angeles, later than usual as to not clash with the </entity/>Winter-Olympics Winter-Olympics in </entity/>Sochi Sochi, Russia.
History.
The </entity/>first-Academy-Awards first-Academy-Awards were presented on May 16, 1929, at a private dinner at the </entity/>Hollywood-Roosevelt-Hotel Hollywood-Roosevelt-Hotel with an audience of about 270 people. The post Academy Awards party was held at the Mayfair Hotel. The cost of guest tickets for that night's ceremony was $5 ($ as of 2015). Fifteen statuettes were awarded, honoring artists, directors and other personalities of the film-making industry of the time for their works during the 1927–28 period; the ceremony ran for 15 minutes.
Winners had been announced to media three months earlier; however, that was changed in the second ceremony of the Academy Awards in 1930. Since then and during the first decade, the results were given to newspapers for publication at 11:00 pm on the night of the awards. This method was used until the "</entity/>Los-Angeles-Times Los-Angeles-Times" announced the winners before the ceremony began; as a result, the Academy has since 1941 used a sealed envelope to reveal the name of the winners.
The first Best Actor awarded was </entity/>Emil-Jannings Emil-Jannings, for his performances in "</entity/>The-Last-Command-(1928-film) </mention/>The-Last-Command" and "</entity/>The-Way-of-All-Flesh-(film) </mention/>The-Way-of-All-Flesh". He had to return to Europe before the ceremony, so the Academy agreed to give him the prize earlier; this made him the first Academy Award winner in history. The honored professionals were awarded for all the work done in a certain category for the qualifying period; for example, Jannings received the award for two movies in which he starred during that period and </entity/>Janet-Gaynor Janet-Gaynor later won a single Oscar for performances in three films. Since the fourth ceremony, the system changed, and professionals were honored for a specific performance in a single film. For the first six ceremonies, the eligibility period spanned two calendar years.
At the 29th ceremony, held on March 27, 1957, the </entity/>Academy-Award-for-Best-Foreign-Language-Film </mention/>Best-Foreign-Language-Film category was introduced. Until then, foreign-language films were honored with the Special Achievement Award.
, a total of 2,809 Oscars have been given away.
Oscar statuette.
Although there are seven other types of annual awards presented by the Academy (the </entity/>Irving-G.-Thalberg-Memorial-Award Irving-G.-Thalberg-Memorial-Award, the </entity/>Jean-Hersholt-Humanitarian-Award Jean-Hersholt-Humanitarian-Award, the </entity/>Gordon-E.-Sawyer-Award Gordon-E.-Sawyer-Award, the </entity/>Academy-Scientific-and-Technical-Award Academy-Scientific-and-Technical-Award, the </entity/>Academy-Award-for-Technical-Achievement Academy-Award-for-Technical-Achievement, the </entity/>John-A.-Bonner-Medal-of-Commendation John-A.-Bonner-Medal-of-Commendation, and the </entity/>Student-Academy-Award Student-Academy-Award) plus two awards that are not presented annually (the Special Achievement Award in the form of an Oscar statuette and the Honorary Award that may or may not be in the form of an Oscar statuette), the best known one is the "Academy Award of Merit" more popularly known as the Oscar statuette. Made of gold-plated </entity/>britannia-metal </mention/>britannium on a black metal base, it is 13.5 in (34 cm) tall, weighs 8.5 lb (3.85 kg) and depicts a knight rendered in </entity/>Art-Deco Art-Deco style holding a </entity/>crusades </mention/>crusader's sword standing on a reel of film with five spokes. The five spokes represent the original branches of the Academy: Actors, Writers, Directors, Producers, and Technicians.
In 1928, </entity/>MGM MGM's art director </entity/>Cedric-Gibbons Cedric-Gibbons, one of the original Academy members, supervised the design of the award </entity/>trophy trophy by printing the design on a scroll.
In need of a model for his statuette, Gibbons was introduced by his future wife </entity/>Dolores-del-Río Dolores-del-Río to Mexican film director and actor </entity/>Emilio-Fernández </mention/>Emilio-"El-Indio"-Fernández. Reluctant at first, Fernández was finally convinced to pose nude to create what today is known as the "Oscar". Then, sculptor </entity/>George-Stanley-(sculptor) </mention/>George-Stanley (who also did the Muse Fountain at the </entity/>Hollywood-Bowl Hollywood-Bowl) sculpted Gibbons's design in clay and Sachin Smith cast the statuette in 92.5 percent </entity/>tin tin and 7.5 percent copper and then gold-plated it. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway & Sons Foundry in </entity/>Batavia,-Illinois Batavia,-Illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the </entity/>Vince-Lombardi-Trophy Vince-Lombardi-Trophy and </entity/>Emmy-Award Emmy-Awards statuettes. Since 1983, approximately 50 Oscars are made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer </entity/>R.S.-Owens-&-Company R.S.-Owens-&-Company. The awards weigh each and take between three to four weeks to manufacture each statue.
In support of the American effort in World War II, the statuettes were made of plaster and were traded in for gold ones after the war had ended.
Naming.
The origin of the name "Oscar" is disputed. One biography of </entity/>Bette-Davis Bette-Davis claims that she named the Oscar after her first husband, band leader Harmon Oscar Nelson; one of the earliest mentions in print of the term "Oscar" dates back to a </entity/>Time-(magazine) </mention/>"Time"-magazine article about the 1934 </entity/>6th-Academy-Awards 6th-Academy-Awards. </entity/>Walt-Disney Walt-Disney is also quoted as thanking the Academy for his Oscar as early as 1932. Another claimed origin is that the Academy's Executive Secretary, </entity/>Margaret-Herrick Margaret-Herrick, first saw the award in 1931 and made reference to the statuette's reminding her of her "Uncle Oscar" (a nickname for her cousin Oscar Pierce). Columnist Sidney Skolsky was present during Herrick's naming and seized the name in his byline, "Employees have affectionately dubbed their famous statuette 'Oscar'". The trophy was officially dubbed the "Oscar" in 1939 by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.
Ownership of Oscar statuettes.
Since 1950, the statuettes have been legally encumbered by the requirement that neither winners nor their heirs may sell the statuettes without first offering to sell them back to the Academy for US$1. If a winner refuses to agree to this stipulation, then the Academy keeps the statuette. Academy Awards not protected by this agreement have been sold in public auctions and private deals for six-figure sums. In December 2011, </entity/>Orson-Welles Orson-Welles' 1941 Oscar for "</entity/>Citizen-Kane Citizen-Kane" (</entity/>Best-Original-Screenplay Best-Original-Screenplay) was put up for auction, after his heirs won a 2004 court decision contending that Welles did not sign any agreement to return the statue to the Academy. On December 20, 2011, it sold in an online auction for US$861,542.
In 1992, Harold Russell needed money for his wife's medical expenses. In a controversial decision, he consigned his 1946 Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for "The Best Years of Our Lives" to Herman Darvick Autograph Auctions, and on August 6, 1992, in New York City, the Oscar sold to a private collector for $60,500. Russell defended his action, saying, "I don't know why anybody would be critical. My wife's health is much more important than sentimental reasons. The movie will be here, even if Oscar isn't." Harold Russell is the only Academy Award winning actor to ever sell an Oscar.
While the Oscar is owned by the recipient, it is essentially not on the open market. </entity/>Mike-Todd </mention/>Michael-Todd's grandson tried to sell Todd's Oscar statuette to a movie prop collector in 1989, but the Academy won the legal battle by getting a permanent injunction. Although some Oscar sales transactions have been successful, some buyers have subsequently returned the statuettes to the Academy, which keeps them in its treasury.
Nomination.
Since 2004, Academy Award nomination results have been announced to the public in late January. Prior to that, the results were announced in early February.
Voters.
The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS), a professional honorary organization, maintains a voting membership of 5,783 .
Academy membership is divided into different branches, with each representing a different discipline in film production. Actors constitute the largest voting bloc, numbering 1,311 members (22 percent) of the Academy's composition. Votes have been certified by the auditing firm </entity/>PricewaterhouseCoopers PricewaterhouseCoopers (and its predecessor </entity/>Price-Waterhouse Price-Waterhouse) for the past 73 annual awards ceremonies.
All AMPAS members must be invited to join by the Board of Governors, on behalf of Academy Branch Executive Committees. Membership eligibility may be achieved by a competitive nomination or a member may submit a name based on other significant contribution to the field of motion pictures.
New membership proposals are considered annually. The Academy does not publicly disclose its membership, although as recently as 2007 press releases have announced the names of those who have been invited to join. The 2007 release also stated that it has just under 6,000 voting members. While the membership had been growing, stricter policies have kept its size steady since then.
In 2012, the results of a study conducted by The Los Angeles Times was published which revealed the demographic breakdown of approximately 88% of AMPAS' voting membership. Of the 5,100+ active voters confirmed, 94% were Caucasian, 77% were male, and 54% were found to be over the age of 60. 33% of voting members are former nominees (14%) and winners (19%).
In May 2011, the Academy sent a letter advising its 6,000 or so voting members that an online system for Oscar voting will be implemented in 2013.
Rules.
According to Rules 2 and 3 of the official Academy Awards Rules, a film must open in the previous calendar year, from midnight at the start of 1 January to midnight at the end of 31 December, in </entity/>Los-Angeles-County,-California Los-Angeles-County,-California, to qualify (except for the Best Foreign Language Film). For example, the 2009 </entity/>Academy-Award-for-Best-Picture </mention/>Best-Picture winner, "</entity/>The-Hurt-Locker The-Hurt-Locker", was actually first released in 2008, but did not qualify for the </entity/>81st-Academy-Awards </mention/>2008-awards as it did not play its Oscar-qualifying run in Los Angeles until mid-2009, thus qualifying for the </entity/>82nd-Academy-Awards </mention/>2009-awards.
Rule 2 states that a film must be feature-length, defined as a minimum of 40 minutes, except for short subject awards, and it must exist either on a </entity/>35-mm-film </mention/>35-mm or </entity/>70-mm-film 70-mm-film print or in 24 frame/s or 48 frame/s </entity/>progressive-scan progressive-scan </entity/>digital-cinema digital-cinema format with native resolution not less than </entity/>720p </mention/>1280×720.
Producers must submit an Official Screen Credits online form before the deadline; in case it is not submitted by the defined deadline, the film will be ineligible for Academy Awards in any year. The form includes the production credits for all related categories. Then, each form is checked and put in a Reminder List of Eligible Releases.
In late December ballots and copies of the Reminder List of Eligible Releases are mailed to around 6000 active members. For most categories, members from each of the branches vote to determine the nominees only in their respective categories (i.e. only directors vote for directors, writers for writers, actors for actors, etc.). In all major categories, voters use an </entity/>instant-runoff-voting instant-runoff-voting ballot, with potential nominees rewarded in the </entity/>single-transferable-vote single-transferable-vote tally for having strong supporters who rank them first. There are some exceptions in the case of certain categories, like Foreign Film, Documentary and Animated Feature Film, in which movies are selected by special screening committees made up of members from all branches. In the special case of Best Picture, all voting members are eligible to select the nominees for that category. Foreign films must include English subtitles, and each country can submit only one film per year.
The winners are then determined by a second round of voting in which all members are then allowed to vote in most categories, including Best Picture.
Film companies will spend as much as several million dollars on marketing to awards voters for a movie in the running for Best Picture, in attempts to improve chances of receiving Oscars and other movie awards conferred in </entity/>Oscar-season Oscar-season. The Academy enforces rules to limit overt campaigning by its members so as to try to eliminate excesses and prevent the process from becoming undignified. It has an awards czar on staff who advises members on allowed practices and levies penalties on offenders. For example, a producer of the 2010 Best Picture nominee, "</entity/>The-Hurt-Locker The-Hurt-Locker," was disqualified as a producer in the category when he contacted associates urging them to vote for his film and not another that was seen as front-runner ("</entity/>The-Hurt-Locker The-Hurt-Locker" eventually won).
Ceremony.
Telecast.
</entity/>
</entity/>
The major awards are presented at a live televised ceremony, most commonly in late February or early March following the relevant calendar year, and six weeks after the announcement of the nominees. It is the culmination of the film awards season, which usually begins during November or December of the previous year. This is an elaborate extravaganza, with the invited guests walking up the red carpet in the creations of the most prominent fashion designers of the day. </entity/>Black-tie Black-tie dress is the most common outfit for men, although fashion may dictate not wearing a </entity/>bow-tie bow-tie, and musical performers sometimes do not adhere to this. (The artists who recorded the nominees for Best Original Song quite often perform those songs live at the awards ceremony, and the fact that they are performing is often used to promote the television broadcast).
The Academy Awards is the only awards show that is televised live in all United States time zones (excluding Hawaii; they aired live in </entity/>Alaska Alaska starting in 2011 for the first time since 1996), Canada, the United Kingdom, and gathers millions of viewers elsewhere throughout the world. The 2007 ceremony was watched by more than 40 million Americans. Other awards ceremonies (such as the Emmys, Golden Globes, and </entity/>Grammy-Award </mention/>Grammys) are broadcast live in the Eastern & Central time zones, but are on </entity/>Broadcast-delay </mention/>tape-delay on the West Coast and might not air the same day outside North America (if the awards are even televised). The Academy has for several years claimed that the award show has up to a billion viewers internationally, but this has so far not been confirmed by any independent sources.
The Awards show was first televised in 1953, on </entity/>NBC NBC, which continued to broadcast the event until 1960 when the </entity/>American-Broadcasting-Company </mention/>ABC Network took over, televising the festivities through 1970, after which NBC resumed the broadcasts. ABC once again took over broadcast duties in 1976 and it is under contract to do so through the year 2020. The first countries to broadcast the Academy Awards on television, aside from the United States, were Canada, the United Kingdom and Mexico; the latter two countries did not broadcast the live show, and Mexico did not carry the live event until 1964. By 1954, seven other countries, namely Brazil, Cuba, Venezuela, West Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and France, were already broadcasting the Awards show, although previously filmed into a condensed 60-minute version, called the "International Edition" of the Academy Awards. The Awards show was broadcast for the first time via satellite in 1970, but only two South American countries, Chile and Brazil purchased the rights to air the live event. By that time, the television rights to the Awards show were sold in 50 countries. A decade later, the TV rights to the Oscars were already being sold to 60 countries, and by 1984, the TV rights to the Awards were licensed in 76 countries. Until the arrival of subscription television in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, which enabled the Oscars to be broadcast live through these territories, there was already available a previously filmed or taped 90-minute version of the Awards show which was aired on broadcast television in these territories. However, several Asian and Australasian countries, such as Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and New Zealand were already carrying the live broadcast of the Awards show since the late 1970s. AMPAS still produces a condensed 90-minute version of the Academy Awards for those territories in which the rights to the live broadcast are expensive.
After more than 60 years of being held in late March or early April, the ceremonies were moved up to late February or early March starting in 2004 to help disrupt and shorten the intense </entity/>For-Your-Consideration-(advertising) </mention/>lobbying-and-ad-campaigns associated with </entity/>Oscar-season Oscar-season in the film industry. Another reason was because of the growing TV ratings success of the </entity/>NCAA-Men's-Division-I-Basketball-Championship NCAA-Men's-Division-I-Basketball-Championship, which would cut into the Academy Awards audience. The earlier date is also to the advantage of ABC, as it now usually occurs during the highly profitable and important February </entity/>sweeps sweeps period. Some years, the ceremony is moved into early March in deference to the </entity/>Winter-Olympics Winter-Olympics. Another reason for the move to late February and early March is to avoid the awards ceremony occurring so close to the religious holidays of </entity/>Passover Passover and </entity/>Easter Easter, which for decades had been a grievance from members and the general public. Advertising is somewhat restricted, however, as traditionally no movie studios or competitors of official Academy Award sponsors may advertise during the telecast. The Awards show holds the distinction of having won the most </entity/>Emmys Emmys in history, with 47 wins and 195 nominations.
After many years of being held on Mondays at 9:00 pm </entity/>Eastern-Time-Zone </mention/>Eastern/6:00 p.m </entity/>Pacific-Time-Zone </mention/>Pacific, in 1999 the ceremonies were moved to Sundays at 8:30 pm Eastern/5:30 pm Pacific. The reasons given for the move were that more viewers would tune in on Sundays, that Los Angeles rush-hour traffic jams could be avoided, and that an earlier start time would allow viewers on the East Coast to go to bed earlier. For many years the film industry had opposed a Sunday broadcast because it would cut into the weekend box office.
On 30 March 1981, the awards ceremony was postponed for one day after </entity/>Reagan-assassination-attempt </mention/>the-shooting of President </entity/>Ronald-Reagan Ronald-Reagan and others in Washington, D.C.
In 1993, an "In Memoriam" segment was introduced, honoring those who had made a significant contribution to cinema who had died in the preceding 12 months, a selection compiled by a small committee of Academy members. This segment has drawn criticism over the years for the omission of some names.
In terms of broadcast length, the ceremony generally averages three and a half hours. The first Oscars, in 1929, lasted 15 minutes. At the other end of the spectrum, the 2000 ceremony lasted four hours and four minutes. In 2010, the organizers of the Academy Awards announced that winners' </entity/>Oscar-speech </mention/>acceptance-speeches must not run past 45 seconds. This, according to organizer Bill Mechanic, was to ensure the elimination of what he termed "the single most hated thing on the show" – overly long and embarrassing displays of emotion.
The Academy has contemplated moving the ceremony even further back into January, citing TV viewers' fatigue with the film industry's long awards season. However, such an accelerated schedule would dramatically decrease the voting period for its members, to the point where some voters would only have time to view the contending films streamed on their computers (as opposed to traditionally receiving the films and ballots in the mail). Also, a January ceremony would have to compete with </entity/>National-Football-League National-Football-League playoff games.
Awards ceremonies.
Historically, the "Oscarcast" has pulled in a bigger haul when box-office hits are favored to win the Best Picture trophy. More than 57.25 million viewers tuned to the telecast for the </entity/>70th-Academy-Awards 70th-Academy-Awards in 1998, the year of "</entity/>Titanic-(1997-film) </mention/>Titanic", which generated close to US$600 million at the North American box office pre-Oscars. The </entity/>76th-Academy-Awards 76th-Academy-Awards ceremony in which "</entity/>" (pre-telecast box office earnings of US$368 million) received 11 Awards including Best Picture drew 43.56 million viewers. The most watched ceremony based on </entity/>Nielsen-ratings Nielsen-ratings to date, however, was the </entity/>42nd-Academy-Awards 42nd-Academy-Awards (Best Picture "</entity/>Midnight-Cowboy Midnight-Cowboy") which drew a 43.4% household rating on 7 April 1970.
By contrast, ceremonies honoring films that have not performed well at the box office tend to show weaker ratings. The </entity/>78th-Academy-Awards 78th-Academy-Awards which awarded low-budgeted, independent film "</entity/>Crash-(2004-film) </mention/>Crash" (with a pre-Oscar gross of US$53.4 million) generated an audience of 38.64 million with a household rating of 22.91%. In 2008, the </entity/>80th-Academy-Awards 80th-Academy-Awards telecast was watched by 31.76 million viewers on average with an 18.66% household rating, the lowest rated and least watched ceremony to date, in spite of celebrating 80 years of the Academy Awards. The Best Picture winner of that particular ceremony was another independently financed film ("</entity/>No-Country-for-Old-Men-(film) </mention/>No-Country-for-Old-Men").
Venues.
</entity/>
In 1929, the first Academy Awards were presented at a banquet dinner at the </entity/>Hollywood-Roosevelt-Hotel Hollywood-Roosevelt-Hotel. From 1930 to 1943, the ceremony alternated between two venues: the </entity/>Ambassador-Hotel-(Los-Angeles) </mention/>Ambassador-Hotel on </entity/>Wilshire-Boulevard Wilshire-Boulevard and the </entity/>Millennium-Biltmore-Hotel </mention/>Biltmore-Hotel in downtown Los Angeles.
</entity/>Grauman's-Chinese-Theater Grauman's-Chinese-Theater in Hollywood then hosted the awards from 1944 to 1946, followed by the </entity/>Shrine-Auditorium Shrine-Auditorium in Los Angeles from 1947 to 1948. The </entity/>21st-Academy-Awards 21st-Academy-Awards in 1949 were held at the Academy Award Theater at what was the Academy's headquarters on </entity/>Melrose-Avenue Melrose-Avenue in Hollywood.
From 1950 to 1960, the awards were presented at Hollywood's </entity/>Pantages-Theatre-(Hollywood) </mention/>Pantages-Theatre. With the advent of television, the 1953–1957 awards took place simultaneously in Hollywood and New York first at the </entity/>Majestic-Theatre-(Columbus-Circle) </mention/>NBC-International-Theatre (1953) and then at the </entity/>New-Century-Theatre </mention/>NBC-Century-Theatre (1954–1957), after which the ceremony took place solely in Los Angeles. The Oscars moved to the </entity/>Santa-Monica-Civic-Auditorium Santa-Monica-Civic-Auditorium in </entity/>Santa-Monica,-California Santa-Monica,-California in 1961. By 1969, the Academy decided to move the ceremonies back to Los Angeles, this time to the </entity/>Dorothy-Chandler-Pavilion Dorothy-Chandler-Pavilion at the </entity/>Los-Angeles-Music-Center </mention/>Los-Angeles-County-Music-Center.
In 2002, the </entity/>Dolby-Theatre </mention/>Kodak-Theatre became the permanent home of the award ceremonies. However, due to </entity/>Eastman-Kodak Eastman-Kodak's bankruptcy issues, this theatre was renamed the </entity/>Dolby-Theatre </mention/>Hollywood-and-Highland-Center in the days preceding the 26 February 2012, awards ceremony. As of May 2012, the theatre was once again renamed – to the </entity/>Dolby-Theatre Dolby-Theatre – after </entity/>Dolby-Laboratories Dolby-Laboratories acquired the naming rights.
Merit categories.
Current categories.
In the first year of the awards, the Best Director award was split into two separate categories (Drama and Comedy). At times, the Best Original Score award has also been split into separate categories (Drama and Comedy/Musical). From the 1930s through the 1960s, the Art Direction (now Production Design), Cinematography, and Costume Design awards were likewise split into two separate categories (black-and-white films and color films). Prior to 2012, the Production Design award was called Art Direction, while the Makeup and Hairstyling award was called Makeup.
Another award, entitled the </entity/>Academy-Award-for-Best-Original-Musical Academy-Award-for-Best-Original-Musical, is still in the Academy rulebooks and has yet to be discontinued. However, due to continuous insufficient eligibility each year, it has not been awarded since 1984 (when "</entity/>Purple-Rain-(film) </mention/>Purple-Rain" won).
Proposed categories.
The Board of Governors meets each year and considers new award categories. To date, the following proposed categories have been rejected:
Special categories.
The Special Academy Awards are voted on by special committees, rather than by the Academy membership as a whole. They are not always presented on a consistent annual basis.
Critical reception and review.
Due to the positive exposure and prestige of the Academy Awards, studios spend millions of dollars and hire publicists specifically to promote their films during what is typically called the "</entity/>Oscar-season Oscar-season". This has generated accusations of the Academy Awards being influenced more by marketing than quality. </entity/>William-Friedkin William-Friedkin, an Academy Award-winning film director and former producer of the ceremony, expressed this sentiment at a conference in New York in 2009, describing it as "the greatest promotion scheme that any industry ever devised for itself".
In addition, some winners critical of the Academy Awards have boycotted the ceremonies and refused to accept their Oscars. The first to do so was </entity/>Dudley-Nichols Dudley-Nichols (Best Writing in 1935 for "</entity/>The-Informer-(1935-film) </mention/>The-Informer"). Nichols boycotted the </entity/>8th-Academy-Awards 8th-Academy-Awards ceremony because of conflicts between the Academy and the Writers' Guild. </entity/>George-C.-Scott George-C.-Scott became the second person to refuse his award (Best Actor in 1970 for "</entity/>Patton-(film) </mention/>Patton") at the </entity/>43rd-Academy-Awards 43rd-Academy-Awards ceremony. Scott described it as a 'meat parade', saying 'I don't want any part of it." The third was </entity/>Marlon-Brando Marlon-Brando, who refused his award (Best Actor in 1972 for "</entity/>The-Godfather The-Godfather"), citing the film industry's discrimination and mistreatment of Native Americans. At the </entity/>45th-Academy-Awards 45th-Academy-Awards ceremony, Brando sent </entity/>Sacheen-Littlefeather Sacheen-Littlefeather to read a 15-page speech detailing his criticisms.
Tim Dirks, editor of </entity/>American-Movie-Classics </mention/>AMC's </entity/>filmsite.org filmsite.org, has written of the Academy Awards,
Typical criticism of the Academy Awards for Best Picture is that among the winners and nominees there is an over-representation of romantic historical epics, biographical dramas, romantic dramedies, and family melodramas, most of which are released in the U.S. the last three months of the calendar year. This has led to the coining of the term '</entity/>Oscar-bait Oscar-bait', describing such movies. Overall, the Academy appears to go through periods of rewarding a certain type of film: war-themed movies in the early 1940s; 'social issue' dramas in the late 1940s, late 1960s, and mid-2000s; musicals and historical epics in the early-to-mid-1960s; family melodramas and biographical epics in the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s; atypical genres (movies formerly considered "</entity/>B-movies B-movies") in the early 1970s and 1990s; romantic historical epic dramas in the late 1990s and early 2000s; independent violent movies from critically acclaimed directors in the late 2000s; and 20th century historical movies in the 2010s. This has led at times to more specific criticisms that the Academy is disconnected from the audience, e.g. by favoring 'Oscar bait' over audience favorites, or favoring historical melodramas over critically acclaimed movies that depict current life issues. The Academy appears to compensate by nominating these movies in other categories, e.g. effects and editing awards for science-fiction and action movies, screenplay and supporting acting nominations for comedies, and directing, cinematography, and foreign language nominations for critically acclaimed </entity/>art-film art-films.
Acting prizes in certain years have been criticized for not recognizing superior performances so much as being awarded for sentimental reasons, personal popularity, atonement for past mistakes, or presented as a "career honor" to recognize a distinguished nominee's entire body of work.
Associated events.
The following events are closely associated with the annual Academy Awards ceremony:
Presenter and performer gifts.
It has been a tradition to give out gift bags to the presenters and performers at the Oscars. In later years these gifts have also been extended to award nominees and winners. The total value of these gifts can reach into the 10s of thousands of dollars. In 2014 the value was reported to be as high as US$ 80,000. The value has risen to the point where the U.S. </entity/>Internal-Revenue-Service Internal-Revenue-Service issued a statement regarding the gifts and their taxable status.
The assortment of gifts varies significantly. Oscar gift bags have included deluxe vacation packages to Hawaii and Mexico and Japan, a private dinner party for the recipient and friends at any </entity/>Morton's-The-Steakhouse </mention/>Morton's-steakhouse worldwide, </entity/>videophone videophones, a four-night stay at Rosewood's </entity/>Badrutt's-Palace-Hotel Badrutt's-Palace-Hotel - a luxury hotel in </entity/>St.-Moritz,-Switzerland St.-Moritz,-Switzerland, Swiss-made watches, Jan Lewis Designs bangle bracelets, luxury vacation packages to the Canadian Rockies, spa treatments, bottles of luxury vodka, maple salad dressing, and weight-loss gummie candy. Some of the gifts have even had a "risque" element to them; in 2014 the adult products retailer </entity/>Adam-&-Eve-(company) </mention/>Adam-&-Eve had a "Secret Room Gifting Suite". Celebrities visiting the gifting suite included </entity/>Judith-Hoag Judith-Hoag, </entity/>Carolyn-Hennesy Carolyn-Hennesy, </entity/>Kate-Linder Kate-Linder, </entity/>Chris-Mulkey Chris-Mulkey, </entity/>Jim-O'Heir Jim-O'Heir, and </entity/>NBA NBA star </entity/>John-Salley John-Salley.

International Atomic Time

International Atomic Time (TAI, from the French name Temps atomique international) is a high-precision atomic </entity/>coordinate-time </mention/>coordinate </entity/>time-standard time-standard based on the notional passage of </entity/>proper-time proper-time on </entity/>Earth Earth's </entity/>geoid geoid. It is the basis for </entity/>Coordinated-Universal-Time Coordinated-Universal-Time (UTC), which is used for civil timekeeping all over the Earth's surface, and for </entity/>Terrestrial-Time Terrestrial-Time, which is used for astronomical calculations. Since 30 June 2012 when the last </entity/>leap-second leap-second was added, TAI has been exactly 35 seconds ahead of UTC. The 35 seconds results from the initial difference of 10 seconds at the start of 1972, plus 25 </entity/>leap-second leap-seconds in UTC since 1972.
Time coordinates on the TAI scales are conventionally specified using traditional means of specifying days, carried over from non-uniform time standards based on the rotation of the Earth. Specifically, both </entity/>Julian-Date Julian-Dates and the </entity/>Gregorian-calendar Gregorian-calendar are used. TAI in this form was synchronised with </entity/>Universal-Time Universal-Time at the beginning of 1958, and the two have drifted apart ever since, due to the changing motion of the Earth.
Operation.
TAI as a time scale is a weighted average of the time kept by over 200 </entity/>atomic-clock atomic-clocks in over 50 national laboratories worldwide. The clocks are compared using </entity/>Global-Positioning-System </mention/>GPS signals and </entity/>two-way-satellite-time-and-frequency-transfer two-way-satellite-time-and-frequency-transfer. Due to the averaging it is far more stable than any clock would be alone (see </entity/>signal-averaging signal-averaging for a discussion). The majority of the clocks are </entity/>Atomic-clock </mention/>caesium-clocks; the definition of the </entity/>International-System-of-Units </mention/>SI second is written in terms of </entity/>caesium caesium.
The participating institutions each broadcast, in </entity/>real-time-data </mention/>real-time, a frequency signal with </entity/>timecode timecodes, which is their estimate of TAI. Time codes are usually published in the form of UTC, which differs from TAI by a well-known integer number of seconds. These time scales are denoted in the form "UTC(NPL)" in the UTC form, where "NPL" in this case identifies the </entity/>National-Physical-Laboratory,-UK National-Physical-Laboratory,-UK. The TAI form may be denoted "TAI(NPL)". The latter is not to be confused with "TA(NPL)", which denotes an independent atomic time scale, not synchronised to TAI or to anything else.
The clocks at different institutions are regularly compared against each other. The </entity/>International-Bureau-of-Weights-and-Measures International-Bureau-of-Weights-and-Measures (BIPM, France), combines these measurements to retrospectively calculate the weighted average that forms the most stable time scale possible. This combined time scale is published monthly in , and is the </entity/>Canonical-form </mention/>canonical TAI. This time scale is expressed in the form of tables of differences UTC-UTC("k") (equivalent to TAI-TAI("k")) for each participating institution "k". (The same circular also gives tables of TAI-TA("k"), for the various unsynchronised atomic time scales.)
Errors in publication may be corrected by issuing a revision of the faulty Circular T or by errata in a subsequent Circular T. Aside from this, once published in Circular T the TAI scale is not revised. In hindsight it is possible to discover errors in TAI, and to make better estimates of the true proper time scale. Doing so does not create another version of TAI; it is instead considered to be creating a better realisation of </entity/>Terrestrial-Time Terrestrial-Time (TT).
History.
Early atomic time scales consisted of quartz clocks with frequencies calibrated by a single atomic clock; the atomic clocks were not operated continuously. Atomic timekeeping services started experimentally in 1955, using the first caesium atomic clock at the </entity/>National-Physical-Laboratory-(United-Kingdom) </mention/>National-Physical-Laboratory,-UK-(NPL). The "Greenwich Atomic" (GA) scale began in 1955 at the </entity/>Royal-Greenwich-Observatory Royal-Greenwich-Observatory. The </entity/>International-Time-Bureau International-Time-Bureau (BIH) began a time scale, Tm or AM, in July 1955, using both local caesium clocks and comparisons to distant clocks using the phase of </entity/>VLF VLF radio signals. The </entity/>United-States-Naval-Observatory United-States-Naval-Observatory began the A.1 scale 13 September 1956, using an Atomichron commercial atomic clock, followed by the NBS-A scale at the National Bureau of Standards, </entity/>Boulder,-Colorado Boulder,-Colorado. Both the BIH scale and A.1 was defined by an </entity/>epoch-(reference-date) </mention/>epoch at the beginning of 1958: it was set to read Julian Date 2436204.5 (1 January 1958 00:00:00) at the corresponding </entity/>UT2 UT2 instant. The procedures used by the BIH evolved, and the name for the time scale changed: "A3" in 1963 and "TA(BIH)" in 1969. This synchronisation was inevitably imperfect, depending as it did on the </entity/>astronomy </mention/>astronomical realisation of UT2. At the time, UT2 as published by various observatories differed by several hundredths of a second.
In 1961, UTC began. UTC is a discontinuous time scale composed from segments that are linear transformations of atomic time, the discontinuities being arranged so that UTC approximated </entity/>UT2 UT2 until the end of 1971, and </entity/>UT1 UT1 thereafter. This was a compromise arrangement for a broadcast time scale: a linear transformation of the BIH's atomic time meant that the time scale was stable and internationally synchronised, while approximating UT1 means that tasks such as </entity/>navigation navigation which require a source of Universal Time continue to be well served by public time broadcasts.
The SI second was defined in terms of the caesium atom in 1967, and in 1971 the name International Atomic Time (TAI) was assigned to a time scale based on SI seconds with no leap seconds. During this time, irregularities in the atomic time were detected and corrected. In 1967 it was suggested that nearby masses caused clocks to operate at different rates, but this was disproven in 1968.
In the 1970s, it became clear that the clocks participating in TAI were ticking at different rates due to </entity/>gravitational-time-dilation gravitational-time-dilation, and the combined TAI scale therefore corresponded to an average of the altitudes of the various clocks. Starting from Julian Date 2443144.5 (1 January 1977 00:00:00), corrections were applied to the output of all participating clocks, so that TAI would correspond to proper time at </entity/>mean-sea-level mean-sea-level (the geoid). Because the clocks had been on average well above sea level, this meant that TAI slowed down, by about 10−12. The former uncorrected time scale continues to be published, under the name "EAL" ("Echelle Atomique Libre", meaning "Free Atomic Scale").
The instant that the gravitational correction started to be applied serves as the epoch for </entity/>Barycentric-Coordinate-Time Barycentric-Coordinate-Time (TCB), </entity/>Geocentric-Coordinate-Time Geocentric-Coordinate-Time (TCG), and </entity/>Terrestrial-Time Terrestrial-Time (TT). All three of these time scales were defined to read JD 2443144.5003725 (1 January 1977 00:00:32.184) exactly at that instant. (The offset is to provide continuity with the older </entity/>Ephemeris-Time Ephemeris-Time.) TAI was henceforth a realisation of TT, with the equation TT(TAI) = TAI + 32.184 s.
The continued existence of TAI was questioned in a 2007 letter from the BIPM to the ITU-R which stated "In the case of a redefinition of UTC without leap seconds, the CCTF would consider discussing the possibility of suppressing TAI, as it would remain parallel to the continuous UTC."

Altruism

</entity/>
Altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the </entity/>Quality-of-life </mention/>welfare of others. It is a traditional </entity/>virtue virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of "others" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of </entity/>selfishness selfishness. The word was coined by the French philosopher </entity/>August-Comte August-Comte in French, as "altruisme", for an </entity/>antonym antonym of egoism. He derived it from an Italian "altrui", which in turn was derived from Latin "alteri", meaning "other people" or "somebody else".
Altruism can be distinguished from feelings of </entity/>loyalty loyalty. Pure altruism consists of sacrificing something for someone other than the self (e.g. sacrificing time, energy or possessions) with no expectation of any compensation or benefits, either direct, or indirect (e.g., receiving recognition for the act of giving).
Much debate exists as to whether "true" altruism is possible. The theory of </entity/>psychological-egoism psychological-egoism suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an </entity/>intrinsic intrinsic reward in the form of personal </entity/>gratification gratification. The validity of this argument depends on whether </entity/>Motivation#Intrinsic-and-extrinsic-motivation </mention/>intrinsic-rewards qualify as "benefits."
The term "</entity/>altruism-(ethics) </mention/>altruism" may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with </entity/>ethical-egoism </mention/>egoism, which is defined as acting to the benefit of one's self.
The notion of altruism.
The concept has a long history in </entity/>Philosophy </mention/>philosophical and </entity/>Ethics </mention/>ethical thought. The term was originally coined in the 19th century by the founding </entity/>sociologist sociologist and </entity/>philosopher-of-science philosopher-of-science, </entity/>Auguste-Comte Auguste-Comte, and has become a major topic for </entity/>psychologists psychologists (especially </entity/>evolutionary-psychology evolutionary-psychology researchers), </entity/>evolutionary-biologists evolutionary-biologists, and </entity/>ethology </mention/>ethologists. Whilst ideas about altruism from one field can have an impact on the other fields, the different methods and focuses of these fields always lead to different perspectives on altruism. In simple terms, altruism is caring about the welfare of other people and acting to help them.
Individual variations.
A certain individual may behave altruistically in one case and egoistically in another situation. However, some individuals tend to behave more altruistically, while others tend to behave more egoistically. Altruism may be considered a general attitude to the point where altruism has been considered as a </entity/>Phenotypic-trait </mention/>trait.
A 1986 study estimated that altruism was half-</entity/>Heritability </mention/>inherited. Another study, by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was published in 2009. Also based on the twin design, the new study estimated that genetic differences accounted for approximately 20% of individual variations.
Scientific viewpoints.
Anthropology.
</entity/>Marcel-Mauss Marcel-Mauss's book "The Gift" contains a passage: "Note on alms." This note describes the evolution of the notion of alms (and by extension of altruism) from the notion of sacrifice. In it, he writes:
Alms are the fruits of a moral notion of the gift and of fortune on the one hand,
and of a notion of sacrifice, on the other. Generosity is an obligation, because Nemesis
avenges the poor and the gods for the superabundance of happiness and wealth
of certain people who should rid themselves of it. This is the ancient morality of the
gift, which has become a principle of justice. The gods and the spirits accept that
the share of wealth and happiness that has been offered to them and had been
hitherto destroyed in useless sacrifices should serve the poor and children.
Evolutionary explanations.
</entity/>
In the science of </entity/>ethology ethology (the study of animal behaviour), and more generally in the study of </entity/>social-evolution social-evolution, altruism refers to behaviour by an individual that increases the </entity/>fitness-(biology) </mention/>fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor. In </entity/>evolutionary-psychology evolutionary-psychology this may be applied to a wide range of human behaviors such as charity, emergency aid, help to coalition partners, </entity/>Tip-(gratuity) </mention/>tipping, courtship gifts, production of </entity/>public-good public-goods, and </entity/>environmentalism environmentalism.
Theories of apparently altruistic behavior were accelerated by the need to produce theories compatible with evolutionary origins. Two related strands of research on altruism have emerged from traditional evolutionary analyses and from </entity/>evolutionary-game-theory evolutionary-game-theory a mathematical model and analysis of behavioural strategies.
Some of the proposed mechanisms are:
</entity/>
</entity/>
Such explanations do not imply that humans are always consciously calculating how to increase their </entity/>inclusive-fitness inclusive-fitness when they are doing altruistic acts. Instead, evolution has shaped psychological mechanisms, such as emotions, that promote altruistic behaviors.
Every single instance of altruistic behavior need not always increase inclusive fitness; altruistic behaviors would have been selected for if such behaviors on average increased inclusive fitness in the ancestral environment. This need not imply that on average 50% or more of altruistic acts were beneficial for the altruist in the ancestral environment; if the benefits from helping the right person were very high it would be beneficial to err on the side of caution and usually be altruistic even if in most cases there were no benefits.
The benefits for the altruist may be increased and the costs reduced by being more altruistic towards certain groups. Research has found that people are more altruistic to kin than to no-kin, to friends than to strangers, to those attractive than to those unattractive, to non-competitors than to competitors, and to members ingroups than to members of outgroup.
The study of altruism was the initial impetus behind </entity/>George-R.-Price George-R.-Price's development of the </entity/>Price-equation Price-equation, which is a mathematical equation used to study genetic evolution. An interesting example of altruism is found in the cellular </entity/>slime-mould slime-moulds, such as "</entity/>Dictyostelid </mention/>Dictyostelium mucoroides." These protists live as individual </entity/>amoebae amoebae until starved, at which point they aggregate and form a multicellular fruiting body in which some cells sacrifice themselves to promote the survival of other cells in the fruiting body.
Selective investment theory proposes that close social bonds, and associated emotional, cognitive, and neurohormonal mechanisms, evolved in order to facilitate long-term, high-cost altruism between those closely depending on one another for survival and reproductive success.
Such cooperative behaviors have sometimes been seen as arguments for left-wing politics such by the Russian zoologist and anarchist </entity/>Peter-Kropotkin Peter-Kropotkin in his 1902 book "</entity/>" and </entity/>Peter-Singer Peter-Singer in his book "</entity/>A-Darwinian-Left A-Darwinian-Left."
Most recently, </entity/>Jeremy-Griffith Jeremy-Griffith has proposed a biological theory for the development of truly altruistic instincts that accommodates the biological imperative to reproduce, as evidenced by a moral conscience visible in humans today.
Neurobiology.
Jorge Moll and Jordan Grafman, neuroscientists at the </entity/>National-Institutes-of-Health National-Institutes-of-Health and LABS-D'Or Hospital Network (J.M.) provided the first evidence for the neural bases of altruistic giving in normal healthy volunteers, using </entity/>functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging functional-magnetic-resonance-imaging. In their research, published in the </entity/>Proceedings-of-the-National-Academy-of-Sciences Proceedings-of-the-National-Academy-of-Sciences USA in October 2006, they showed that both pure monetary rewards and charitable donations activated the </entity/>Mesolimbic-pathway </mention/>mesolimbic reward pathway, a primitive part of the brain that usually lights up in response to food and sex. However, when volunteers generously placed the interests of others before their own by making charitable donations, another brain circuit was selectively activated: the subgenual cortex/septal region. These structures are intimately related to social attachment and bonding in other species. Altruism, the experiment suggested, was not a superior moral faculty that suppresses basic selfish urges but rather was basic to the brain, hard-wired and pleasurable.
Another experiment funded by the </entity/>National-Institutes-of-Health National-Institutes-of-Health and conducted in 2007 at the </entity/>Duke-University Duke-University in </entity/>Durham,-North-Carolina Durham,-North-Carolina suggests a different view, "that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it." In the study published in the February 2007 print issue of </entity/>Nature-Neuroscience Nature-Neuroscience, researchers have found a part of the brain that behaves differently for altruistic and selfish people.
The researchers invited 45 volunteers to play a computer game and also to watch the computer play the game. In some rounds, the game resulted in the volunteers winning money for themselves, and in others it resulted in money being donated to a charity of the volunteer's choice. During these activities, the researchers took functional magnetic resonance imaging (</entity/>fMRI fMRI) scans of the participants' brains and were "surprised by the results". Although they "were expecting to see activity in the brain's reward centers," based on the idea that "people perform altruistic acts because they feel good about it," what they found was that "another part of the brain was also involved, and it was quite sensitive to the difference between doing something for personal gain and doing it for someone else's gain." That part of the brain is called the posterior superior </entity/>temporal-cortex temporal-cortex (pSTC).
In the next stage, the scientists asked the participants some questions about type and frequency of their altruistic or helping behaviours. They then analysed the responses to generate an estimate of a person's tendency to act altruistically and compared each person's level of altruism against their </entity/>fMRI fMRI </entity/>brain-scan brain-scan. The results showed that pSTC activity rose in proportion to a person's self-reported level of altruism. According to the researchers, the results suggest that altruistic behavior may originate from how people view the world rather than how they act in it. "We believe that the ability to perceive other people's actions as meaningful is critical for altruism," said lead study investigator Dharol Tankersley.
Psychology.
The International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences defines "psychological altruism" as "a motivational state with the goal of increasing another’s welfare." Psychological altruism is contrasted with "psychological egoism," which refers to the motivation to increase one’s own welfare.
There has been some debate on whether or not humans are truly capable of psychological altruism. Some definitions specify a self-sacrificial nature to altruism and a lack of external rewards for altruistic behaviors. However, because altruism ultimately benefits the self in many cases, the selflessness of altruistic acts is brought to question. The </entity/>social-exchange-theory social-exchange-theory postulates that altruism only exists when benefits outweigh costs. </entity/>Daniel-Batson Daniel-Batson is a psychologist who examined this question and argues against the social exchange theory. He identified four major motives for altruism: altruism to ultimately benefit the self (egoism), to ultimately benefit the other person (altruism), to benefit a group (collectivism), or to uphold a moral principle (</entity/>principlism principlism). Altruism that ultimately serves selfish gains is thus differentiated from selfless altruism, but the general conclusion has been that empathy-induced altruism can be genuinely selfless. The "</entity/>empathy-altruism empathy-altruism hypothesis" basically states that psychological altruism does exist and is evoked by the empathic desire to help someone who is suffering. Feelings of empathic concern are contrasted with feelings of personal distress, which compel people to reduce their own unpleasant emotions. People with empathic concern help others in distress even when exposure to the situation could be easily avoided, whereas those lacking in empathic concern avoid helping unless it is difficult or impossible to avoid exposure to another's suffering. Helping behavior is seen in humans at about two years old, when a toddler is capable of understanding subtle emotional cues.
</entity/>
In psychological research on altruism, studies often observe altruism as demonstrated through prosocial behaviors such as helping, comforting, sharing, cooperation, philanthropy, and community service. Research has found that people are most likely to help if they recognize that a person is in need and feel personal responsibility for reducing the person's distress. Research also suggests that the number of bystanders witnessing distress or suffering affects the likelihood of helping (the "</entity/>Bystander-effect Bystander-effect"). Greater numbers of bystanders decrease individual feelings of responsibility. However, a witness with a high level of empathic concern is likely to assume personal responsibility entirely regardless of the number of bystanders. A feeling of personal responsibility or - moral norm - has also strongly been associated with other pro-social behaviors such as charitable giving.
Many studies have observed the effects of volunteerism (as a form of altruism) on happiness and health and have consistently found a strong connection between volunteerism and current and future health and well-being. In a study of older adults, those who volunteered were significantly higher on life satisfaction and will to live, and significantly lower in </entity/>Depression-(mood) </mention/>depression, </entity/>anxiety anxiety, and </entity/>somatization somatization. Volunteerism and helping behavior have not only been shown to improve mental health, but physical health and longevity as well. One study examined the physical health of mothers who volunteered over a 30-year period and found that 52% of those who did not belong to a volunteer organization experienced a major illness while only 36% of those who did volunteer experienced one. A study on adults ages 55+ found that during the four-year study period, people who volunteered for two or more organizations had a 63% lower likelihood of dying. After controlling for prior health status, it was determined that volunteerism accounted for a 44% reduction in mortality. Merely being aware of kindness in oneself and others is also associated with greater well-being. A study that asked participants to count each act of kindness they performed for one week significantly enhanced their subjective happiness.
It is important to note that, while research supports the idea that altruistic acts bring about happiness, it has also been found to work in the opposite direction—that happier people are also kinder. The relationship between altruistic behavior and happiness is bidirectional. Studies have found that generosity increases linearly from sad to happy affective states. Studies have also been careful to note that feeling over-taxed by the needs of others has conversely negative effects on health and happiness. For example, one study on volunteerism found that feeling overwhelmed by others' demands had an even stronger negative effect on mental health than helping had a positive one (although positive effects were still significant). Additionally, while generous acts make people feel good about themselves, it is also important for people to appreciate the kindness they receive from others. Studies suggest that gratitude goes hand-in-hand with kindness and is also very important for our well-being. A study on the relationship happiness to various character strengths showed that "a conscious focus on gratitude led to reductions in negative affect and increases in optimistic appraisals, positive affect, offering emotional support, sleep quality, and well-being.". Psychologists generally refer to this virtuous cycle of helping others, doing good and subsequently feeling good as "the helper's high".
Sociology.
"Sociologists have long been concerned with how to build the good society" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity". American Sociological Association.). The structure of our societies and how individuals come to exhibit charitable, philanthropic, and other pro-social, altruistic actions for the common good is a largely researched topic within the field. The American Sociology Association (ASA) acknowledges </entity/>Public-sociology Public-sociology saying, "The intrinsic scientific, policy, and public relevance of this field of investigation in helping to construct 'good societies' is unquestionable" ("Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity" ASA). This type of sociology seeks contributions that aid grassroots and theoretical understandings of what motivates altruism and how it is organized, and promotes an altruistic focus in order to benefit the world and people it studies. How altruism is framed, organized, carried out, and what motivates it at the group level is an area of focus that sociologists seek to investigate in order to contribute back to the groups it studies and "build the good society".
Religious viewpoints.
Most, if not all, of the world's religions promote altruism as a very important moral value. </entity/>Buddhism Buddhism, </entity/>Christianity Christianity, </entity/>Hinduism Hinduism, </entity/>Islam Islam, </entity/>Jainism Jainism, </entity/>Judaism Judaism and </entity/>Sikhism Sikhism, etc., place particular emphasis on altruistic morality.
Buddhism.
</entity/>
Altruism figures prominently in Buddhism. Love and compassion are components of all forms of Buddhism, and are focused on all beings equally: love is the wish that all beings be happy, and compassion is the wish that all beings be free from suffering. "Many illnesses can be cured by the one medicine of love and compassion. These qualities are the ultimate source of human happiness, and the need for them lies at the very core of our being" (Dalai Lama).
Since "all beings" includes the individual, love and compassion in Buddhism are outside the opposition between self and other. It is even said that the distinction between self and other is part of the root cause of our suffering. In practical terms, however, since most of us are spontaneously self-centered, Buddhism encourages us to focus love and compassion on others, and thus can be characterized as "altruistic." Many would agree with the </entity/>Dalai-Lama Dalai-Lama that Buddhism as a religion is kindness toward others.
Still, the notion of altruism is modified in such a world-view, since the belief is that such a practice promotes our own happiness: "The more we care for the happiness of others, the greater our own sense of well-being becomes" (Dalai Lama).
In the context of larger ethical discussions on moral action and judgment, Buddhism is characterized by the belief that negative (unhappy) consequences of our actions derive not from punishment or correction based on moral judgment, but from the law of karma, which functions like a natural law of cause and effect. A simple illustration of such cause and effect is the case of experiencing the effects of what I cause: if I cause suffering, then as a natural consequence I will experience suffering; if I cause happiness, then as a natural consequence I will experience happiness.
In Buddhism, "karma" (Pāli "kamma") is strictly distinguished from </entity/>vipaka </mention/>vipāka, meaning "fruit" or "result". Karma is categorized within the group or groups of cause (Pāli "hetu") in the </entity/>Twelve-nidanas </mention/>chain of </entity/>Pratitya-samutpada </mention/>cause-and-effect, where it comprises the elements of "volitional activities" (Pali "sankhara") and "action" (Pali "bhava"). Any action is understood to create "seeds" in the mind that sprout into the appropriate results (Pāli "vipaka") when they meet the right conditions. Most types of karmas, with good or bad results, will keep one in the wheel of </entity/>Samsara-(Buddhism) </mention/>samsāra; others will liberate one to </entity/>nirvana </mention/>nirvāna.
Buddhism relates karma directly to motives behind an action. Motivation usually makes the difference between "good" and "bad", but motivation also includes the aspect of ignorance; so a well-intended action from an ignorant mind can easily be "bad" in that it creates unpleasant results for the "actor."
In Buddhism, karma is not the only cause of all that happens. As taught in the early texts, the commentarial tradition classified causal mechanisms governing the universe in five categories, known as Niyama Dhammas:
Jainism.
The fundamental principles of </entity/>Jainism Jainism revolve around the concept of altruism, not only for humans but for all sentient beings. Jainism preaches the view of </entity/>Ahimsa Ahimsa – to live and let live, thereby not harming sentient beings, i.e. uncompromising reverence for all life. It also considers all living things to be equal. The first Thirthankar, Rishabh introduced the concept of altruism for all living beings, from extending knowledge and experience to others to donation, giving oneself up for others, non-violence and compassion for all living things.
Jainism prescribes a path of non-violence to progress the soul to this ultimate goal. Jains believe that to attain enlightenment and ultimately liberation, one must practice the following ethical principles (major vows) in thought, speech and action. The degree to which these principles are practiced is different for householders and monks. They are:
A major characteristic of Jain belief is the emphasis on the consequences of not only physical but also mental behaviors. One's unconquered mind with anger, pride (ego), deceit, greed and uncontrolled sense organs are the powerful enemies of humans. Anger spoils good relations, pride destroys humility, deceit destroys peace and greed destroys everything. Jainism recommends conquering anger by forgiveness, pride (ego) by humility, deceit by straight-forwardness and greed by contentment.
The principle of non-violence seeks to minimize karmas which limit the capabilities of the soul. Jainism views every soul as worthy of respect because it has the potential to become Siddha (Param-atma – "highest soul"). Because all living beings possess a soul, great care and awareness is essential in one's actions. Jainism emphasizes the equality of all life, advocating harmlessness towards all, whether the creatures are great or small. This policy extends even to microscopic organisms. Jainism acknowledges that every person has different capabilities and capacities to practice and therefore accepts different levels of compliance for ascetics and householders. The "great vows" (mahavrata) are prescribed for monks and "limited vows" (anuvrata) are prescribed for householders. In other words, the house-holders are encouraged to practice the five cardinal principles of non-violence, truthfulness, non-stealing, celibacy and non-possessiveness with their current practical limitations while the monks have to observe them very strictly. With consistent practice, it will be possible to overcome the limitations gradually, accelerating the spiritual progress.
Christianity.
</entity/>
Altruism is central to the teachings of Jesus found in the </entity/>Gospel Gospel, especially in the </entity/>Sermon-on-the-Mount Sermon-on-the-Mount and the </entity/>Sermon-on-the-Plain Sermon-on-the-Plain. From biblical to medieval </entity/>Christian-traditions Christian-traditions, tensions between self-affirmation and other-regard were sometimes discussed under the heading of "disinterested love", as in the </entity/>Paul-the-Apostle </mention/>Pauline phrase "love seeks not its own interests." In his book "Indoctrination and Self-deception," Roderick Hindery tries to shed light on these tensions by contrasting them with impostors of authentic self-affirmation and altruism, by analysis of other-regard within creative individuation of the self, and by contrasting love for the few with love for the many. Love confirms others in their freedom, shuns propaganda and masks, assures others of its presence, and is ultimately confirmed not by mere declarations from others, but by each person's experience and practice from within. As in practical arts, the presence and meaning of love becomes validated and grasped not by words and reflections alone, but in the making of the connection.
</entity/>St-Thomas-Aquinas St-Thomas-Aquinas interprets 'You should love your neighbour as yourself' as meaning that love for ourselves is the exemplar of love for others. Considering that "the love with which a man loves himself is the form and root of friendship" and quotes Aristotle that "the origin of friendly relations with others lies in our relations to ourselves," he concluded that though we are not bound to love others more than ourselves, we naturally seek the common good, the good of the whole, more than any private good, the good of a part. However, he thinks we should love God more than ourselves and our neighbours, and more than our bodily life—since the ultimate purpose of loving our neighbour is to share in eternal beatitude: a more desirable thing than bodily well being. In coining the word Altruism, as stated above, </entity/>Auguste-Comte </mention/>Comte was probably opposing this Thomistic doctrine, which is present in some theological schools within Catholicism.
Many biblical authors draw a strong connection between love of others and love of God. 1 John 4 states that for one to love God one must love his fellowman, and that hatred of one's fellowman is the same as hatred of God. </entity/>Thomas-Jay-Oord Thomas-Jay-Oord has argued in several books that altruism is but one possible form of love. An altruistic action is not always a loving action. Oord defines altruism as acting for the other's good, and he agrees with feminists who note that sometimes love requires acting for one's own good when the other's demands undermine overall well-being.
German philosopher </entity/>Max-Scheler Max-Scheler distinguishes two ways in which the strong can help the weak. One way is a sincere expression of Christian love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence". Another way is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business." At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."
Islam.
In </entity/>Islam Islam, the concept 'īthār' (altruism) is the notion of 'preferring others to oneself'. For Sufis, this means devotion to others through complete forgetfulness of one's own concerns, where concern for others is rooted to be a demand made by Allah on the human body, considered to be property of Allah alone. The importance lies in sacrifice for the sake of the greater good; </entity/>Islam Islam considers those practicing īthār as abiding by the highest degree of nobility.
This is similar to the notion of chivalry, but unlike that European concept, in i'thar attention is focused on everything in existence. A constant concern for </entity/>Allah Allah (i.e. God) results in a careful attitude towards people, animals, and other things in this world.
This concept was emphasized by Sufis of Islam like </entity/>Rabia-al-Adawiyya Rabia-al-Adawiyya who paid attention to the difference between dedication to </entity/>Allah Allah (i.e. God) and dedication to people. Thirteenth-century Turkish Sufi poet </entity/>Yunus-Emre Yunus-Emre explained this philosophy as "Yaratılanı severiz, Yaratandan ötürü" or "We love the creature, because of The Creator." For many Muslims, i'thar must be practiced as a religious obligation during specific Islamic holidays. However, i'thar is also still an Islamic ideal to which all Muslims should strive to adhere at all times.
Judaism.
Judaism defines altruism as the desired goal of creation. The famous Rabbi </entity/>Abraham-Isaac-Kook Abraham-Isaac-Kook stated that love is the most important attribute in humanity. This is defined as </entity/>Corporate-welfare </mention/>bestowal, or giving, which is the intention of altruism. This can be altruism towards humanity that leads to altruism towards the creator or God. </entity/>Kabbalah Kabbalah defines God as the force of giving in </entity/>existence existence. Rabbi </entity/>Moshe-Chaim-Luzzatto Moshe-Chaim-Luzzatto in particular focused on the 'purpose of creation' and how the will of God was to bring creation into perfection and adhesion with this upper force.
Modern Kabbalah developed by Rabbi </entity/>Yehuda-Ashlag Yehuda-Ashlag, in his writings about the future generation, focuses on how society could achieve an altruistic social framework. Ashlag proposed that such a framework is the purpose of creation, and everything that happens is to raise humanity to the level of altruism, love for one another. Ashlag focused on society and its relation to </entity/>divinity divinity.
Sikhism.
Altruism is essential to the Sikh religion. 
The central faith in Sikhism is that the greatest deed any one can do is to imbibe and live the godly qualities like love, affection, sacrifice, patience, harmony, truthfulness.
The fifth Nanak, Guru Arjun Dev Sacrificed his life to uphold 22 carats of pure truth, the greatest gift to humanity, the Guru Granth. The ninth Nanak, Guru Tegh Bahadur sacrificed his head to protect weak and defenseless people against atrocity. In the late sventeenth century, </entity/>Guru-Gobind-Singh Guru-Gobind-Singh Ji (the tenth </entity/>guru guru in Sikhism), was in war with the </entity/>Moghul Moghul rulers to protect the people of different faiths, when a fellow Sikh, </entity/>Bhai-Kanhaiya Bhai-Kanhaiya, attended the troops of the enemy. He gave water to both friends and foes who were wounded on the battlefield. Some of the enemy began to fight again and some Sikh warriors were annoyed by Bhai Kanhaiya as he was helping their enemy. Sikh soldiers brought Bhai Kanhaiya before Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and complained of his action that they considered counter-productive to their struggle on the battlefield.
"What were you doing, and why?" asked the Guru. "I was giving water to the wounded because I saw your face in all of them," replied Bhai Kanhaiya.
The Guru responded, "Then you should also give them ointment to heal their wounds. You were practicing what you were coached in the house of the Guru."
It was under the tutelage of the Guru that Bhai Kanhaiya subsequently founded a volunteer corps for altruism. This volunteer corps still to date is engaged in doing good to others and trains new volunteering recruits for doing the same.
Hinduism.
</entity/>Advaita-Vedanta Advaita-Vedanta differs from the view that karma is a law of cause and effect but instead additionally hold that karma is mediated by the will of a personal supreme god. This view of karma is in contradiction to </entity/>Buddhism Buddhism, </entity/>Jainism Jainism and other </entity/>Indian-religions Indian-religions that do view karma as a law of cause and effect.
</entity/>Swami-Sivananda Swami-Sivananda, an </entity/>Advaita Advaita scholar, reiterates the same views in his commentary synthesising Vedanta views on the </entity/>Brahma-Sutras Brahma-Sutras, a Vedantic text. In his commentary on Chapter 3 of the Brahma Sutras, Sivananda notes that karma is insentient and short-lived, and ceases to exist as soon as a deed is executed. Hence, karma cannot bestow the fruits of actions at a future date according to one's merit. Furthermore, one cannot argue that karma generates </entity/>apurva apurva or </entity/>Merit-(Buddhism) </mention/>punya, which gives fruit. Since apurva is non-sentient, it cannot act unless moved by an intelligent being such as a god. It cannot independently bestow reward or punishment.
Philosophy.
There exists a wide range of philosophical views on man's obligations or motivations to act altruistically. Proponents of </entity/>Altruism-(ethics) </mention/>ethical-altruism maintain that individuals are morally obligated to act altruistically. The opposing view is </entity/>ethical-egoism ethical-egoism, which maintains that moral agents should always act in their own self-interest. Both ethical altruism and ethical egoism contrast with </entity/>utilitarianism utilitarianism, which is the view that every individual's well-being (including one's own) is of equal moral importance.
A related concept in </entity/>descriptive-ethics descriptive-ethics is </entity/>psychological-egoism psychological-egoism, the thesis that humans always act in their own self-interest and that true altruism is impossible. </entity/>Rational-egoism Rational-egoism is the view that </entity/>rationality rationality consists in acting in one's self-interest (without specifying how this affects one's moral obligations).

Ayn Rand

Ayn Rand (; born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum; – March 6, 1982) was a </entity/>Russian-American Russian-American </entity/>novelist novelist, philosopher, playwright, and screenwriter. She is known for her two best-selling novels, "</entity/>The-Fountainhead The-Fountainhead" and "</entity/>Atlas-Shrugged Atlas-Shrugged", and for developing a philosophical system she called </entity/>Objectivism-(Ayn-Rand) </mention/>Objectivism. Born and educated in </entity/>Russian-American </mention/>Russia, Rand moved to the United States in 1926. She had a play produced on Broadway in 1935–1936. After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful in America, she achieved fame with her 1943 novel, "The Fountainhead".
In 1957, she published her best-known work, the novel "Atlas Shrugged". Afterward, she turned to non-fiction to promote her philosophy, publishing her own magazines and releasing several collections of essays until her death in 1982. Rand advocated </entity/>reason reason as the only means of acquiring </entity/>knowledge knowledge and rejected faith and religion. She supported </entity/>rational-egoism </mention/>rational and </entity/>ethical-egoism ethical-egoism, and rejected </entity/>Altruism-(ethics) </mention/>altruism. In politics, she condemned the </entity/>initiation-of-force initiation-of-force as immoral and opposed </entity/>collectivism collectivism and </entity/>statism statism as well as </entity/>anarchism anarchism, instead supporting "</entity/>laissez-faire laissez-faire" </entity/>capitalism capitalism, which she defined as the system based on recognizing </entity/>individual-rights individual-rights. In art, Rand promoted </entity/>romantic-realism romantic-realism. She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her, except for some </entity/>Aristotelians Aristotelians and </entity/>classical-liberals classical-liberals.
Literary critics received Rand's fiction with mixed reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest has increased in recent decades. The </entity/>Objectivist-movement Objectivist-movement attempts to spread her ideas, both to the public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among </entity/>libertarians libertarians and </entity/>American-conservatives American-conservatives.
Life.
Early life.
Rand was born Alisa Zinov'yevna Rosenbaum () on February 2, 1905, to a </entity/>Russian-Jew Russian-Jewish </entity/>bourgeois bourgeois family living in </entity/>Saint-Petersburg Saint-Petersburg. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum and his wife, Anna Borisovna (née Kaplan), largely non-observant </entity/>Jews Jews. Zinovy Rosenbaum was a successful pharmacist and businessman, eventually owning a pharmacy and the building in which it was located. With a passion for the liberal arts, Rand found school unchallenging, and said she began writing screenplays at the age of eight and novels at the age of ten. At the prestigious Stoiunina Gymnasium, her closest friend was </entity/>Vladimir-Nabokov Vladimir-Nabokov's younger sister, Olga. The two girls shared an intense interest in politics and would engage in debates: while Nabokova defended constitutional monarchy, Rand supported republican ideals. She was twelve at the time of the </entity/>February-Revolution February-Revolution of 1917, during which she favored </entity/>Alexander-Kerensky Alexander-Kerensky over </entity/>Tsar Tsar </entity/>Nicholas-II Nicholas-II.
The subsequent </entity/>October-Revolution October-Revolution and the rule of the </entity/>Bolshevik Bolsheviks under </entity/>Vladimir-Lenin Vladimir-Lenin disrupted the comfortable life the family had previously enjoyed. Her father’s business was confiscated and the family displaced. They fled to the </entity/>Crimean-Peninsula Crimean-Peninsula, which was initially under control of the </entity/>White-Army White-Army during the </entity/>Russian-Civil-War Russian-Civil-War. She later recalled that, while in high school, she determined that she was an </entity/>atheist atheist and that she valued </entity/>reason reason above any other human virtue. After graduating from high school in the Crimea at 16, Rand returned with her family to Petrograd (as Saint Petersburg was renamed at that time), where they faced desperate conditions, on occasion nearly starving.
</entity/>
After the Russian Revolution, universities were opened to women, allowing Rand to be in the first group of women to enroll at </entity/>Petrograd-State-University Petrograd-State-University, where, at the age of only 16, she began her studies in the department of </entity/>social-pedagogy social-pedagogy, majoring in history. At the university she was introduced to the writings of </entity/>Aristotle Aristotle and </entity/>Plato Plato, who would be her greatest influence and counter-influence, respectively. A third figure whose philosophical works she studied heavily was </entity/>Friedrich-Nietzsche Friedrich-Nietzsche. Able to read French, German and Russian, Rand also discovered the writers </entity/>Fyodor-Dostoevsky Fyodor-Dostoevsky, </entity/>Victor-Hugo Victor-Hugo, </entity/>Edmond-Rostand Edmond-Rostand, and </entity/>Friedrich-Schiller Friedrich-Schiller, who became her perennial favorites.
Along with many other "bourgeois" students, Rand was purged from the university shortly before graduating. However, after complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists, many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate, which Rand did in October 1924. She subsequently studied for a year at the State </entity/>Technicum Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad. For one of her assignments, she wrote an essay about the </entity/>Polish-people </mention/>Polish actress </entity/>Pola-Negri Pola-Negri, which became her first published work.
By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be "Rand", possibly as a </entity/>Cyrillic Cyrillic contraction of her birth surname, and she adopted the first name "Ayn", either from a </entity/>Finnish-language </mention/>Finnish name or from the </entity/>Hebrew Hebrew word ("ayin", meaning "eye").
Arrival in the United States.
</entity/>
In the fall of 1925, Rand was granted a </entity/>Visa-(document) </mention/>visa to visit American relatives. She departed on January 17, 1926. When she arrived in New York City on February 19, 1926, she was so impressed with the skyline of </entity/>Manhattan Manhattan that she cried what she later called "tears of splendor". Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter, she lived for a few months with relatives in </entity/>Chicago Chicago, one of whom owned a movie theater and allowed her to watch dozens of films for free. She then set out for </entity/>Hollywood,-California Hollywood,-California.
Initially, Rand struggled in Hollywood and took odd jobs to pay her basic living expenses. A chance meeting with famed director </entity/>Cecil-B.-DeMille Cecil-B.-DeMille led to a job as an </entity/>extra-(drama) </mention/>extra in his film "</entity/>The-King-of-Kings-(1927-film) </mention/>The-King-of-Kings" as well as subsequent work as a junior screenwriter. While working on "The King of Kings", she met an aspiring young actor, Frank O'Connor; the two were married on April 15, 1929. Rand </entity/>United-States-nationality-law#Naturalization </mention/>became-an-American-citizen in 1931. Taking various jobs during the 1930s to support her writing, she worked for a time as the head of the costume department at </entity/>RKO RKO Studios. She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States, but they were unable to acquire permission to emigrate.
Early fiction.
Rand's first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay "</entity/>Red-Pawn Red-Pawn" to </entity/>Universal-Studios Universal-Studios in 1932, although it was never produced. This was followed by the courtroom drama "</entity/>Night-of-January-16th Night-of-January-16th", first produced by </entity/>E.E.-Clive E.E.-Clive in Hollywood in 1934 and then successfully reopened on </entity/>Broadway-theater </mention/>Broadway in 1935. Each night the "jury" was selected from members of the audience, and one of the two different endings, depending on the jury's "verdict", would then be performed. In 1941, </entity/>Paramount-Pictures Paramount-Pictures produced a </entity/>The-Night-of-January-16th-(film) </mention/>movie-loosely-based-on-the-play. Rand did not participate in the production and was highly critical of the result.
Rand's first novel, the semi-autobiographical "</entity/>We-the-Living We-the-Living", was published in 1936. Set in </entity/>Soviet-Russia Soviet-Russia, it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state. In a 1959 foreword to the novel, Rand stated that "We the Living" "is as near to an autobiography as I will ever write. It is not an autobiography in the literal, but only in the intellectual sense. The plot is invented, the background is not..." Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print, although European editions continued to sell. After the success of her later novels, Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies. Without Rand's knowledge or permission, the novel was made into a pair of Italian films, "Noi vivi" and "Addio, Kira", in 1942. Rediscovered in the 1960s, these films were re-edited into a new version which was approved by Rand and re-released as "</entity/>We-the-Living-(film) </mention/>We-the-Living" in 1986.
Her novella "</entity/>Anthem-(novella) </mention/>Anthem" was written during a break from the writing of her next major novel, "The Fountainhead". It presents a vision of a </entity/>dystopian dystopian future world in which </entity/>totalitarian totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word 'I' has been forgotten and replaced with 'we'. It was published in England in 1938, but Rand initially could not find an American publisher. As with "We the Living", Rand's later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946, which has sold more than 3.5 million copies.
"The Fountainhead" and political activism.
During the 1940s, Rand became politically active. Both she and her husband worked full-time in volunteer positions for the 1940 presidential campaign of Republican </entity/>Wendell-Willkie Wendell-Willkie. This work led to Rand's first public speaking experiences, including fielding the sometimes hostile questions from New York City audiences who had just viewed pro-Willkie </entity/>newsreels newsreels, an experience she greatly enjoyed. This activity also brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to free-market capitalism. She became friends with journalist </entity/>Henry-Hazlitt Henry-Hazlitt and his wife, and Hazlitt introduced her to the </entity/>Austrian-School Austrian-School economist </entity/>Ludwig-von-Mises Ludwig-von-Mises. Despite her philosophical differences with them, Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career, and both of them expressed admiration for her. Once Mises referred to Rand as "the most courageous man in America", a compliment that particularly pleased her because he said "man" instead of "woman". Rand also developed a friendship with libertarian writer </entity/>Isabel-Paterson Isabel-Paterson. Rand questioned the well-informed Paterson about American history and politics long into the night during their numerous meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book, "</entity/>The-God-of-the-Machine The-God-of-the-Machine".
Rand's first major success as a writer came with "</entity/>The-Fountainhead The-Fountainhead" in 1943, a romantic and philosophical novel that she wrote over a period of seven years. The novel centers on an uncompromising young architect named </entity/>Howard-Roark Howard-Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as "second-handers"—those who attempt to live through others, placing others above themselves. It was rejected by twelve publishers before finally being accepted by the </entity/>Bobbs-Merrill-Company Bobbs-Merrill-Company on the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden, who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it. While completing the novel, Rand was prescribed </entity/>Benzedrine Benzedrine, a brand of </entity/>amphetamine amphetamine, to fight fatigue. The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the finished novel, but when the book was done, she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks' rest. Her continued use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings.
"The Fountainhead" eventually became a worldwide success, bringing Rand fame and financial security. In 1943, Rand sold the rights for a </entity/>The-Fountainhead-(film) </mention/>film-version to </entity/>Warner-Bros. Warner-Bros., and she returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay. Finishing her work on that screenplay, she was hired by producer </entity/>Hal-Wallis Hal-Wallis as a screenwriter and script-doctor. Her work for Wallis included the screenplays for the </entity/>Academy-Award </mention/>Oscar-nominated "</entity/>Love-Letters-(1945-film) </mention/>Love-Letters" and "</entity/>You-Came-Along You-Came-Along". This role gave Rand time to work on other projects, including a planned nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called "The Moral Basis of Individualism". Although the planned book was never completed, a condensed version was published as an essay titled "The Only Path to Tomorrow", in the January 1944 edition of "</entity/>Reader's-Digest Reader's-Digest" magazine.
Rand extended her involvement with free-market and </entity/>anti-communist anti-communist activism while working in Hollywood. She became involved with the </entity/>Motion-Picture-Alliance-for-the-Preservation-of-American-Ideals Motion-Picture-Alliance-for-the-Preservation-of-American-Ideals, a Hollywood anti-Communist group, and wrote articles on the group's behalf. She also joined the anti-Communist </entity/>American-Writers-Association American-Writers-Association. A visit by Isabel Paterson to meet with Rand's California associates led to a final falling out between the two when Paterson made comments that Rand saw as rude to valued political allies. In 1947, during the </entity/>Second-Red-Scare Second-Red-Scare, Rand testified as a "friendly witness" before the United States </entity/>House-Un-American-Activities-Committee House-Un-American-Activities-Committee. Her testimony described the disparity between her personal experiences in the </entity/>Soviet-Union Soviet-Union and the portrayal of it in the 1944 film "</entity/>Song-of-Russia Song-of-Russia". Rand argued that the film grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union, portraying life there as being much better and happier than it actually was. She wanted to also criticize the lauded 1946 film "</entity/>The-Best-Years-of-Our-Lives The-Best-Years-of-Our-Lives" for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world, but she was not allowed to testify about it. When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the effectiveness of the investigations, Rand described the process as "futile".
After several delays, the film version of "The Fountainhead" was released in 1949. Although it used Rand's screenplay with minimal alterations, she "disliked the movie from beginning to end", complaining about its editing, acting, and other elements.
"Atlas Shrugged" and Objectivism.
In the years following the publication of "The Fountainhead", Rand received numerous letters from readers, some of whom it profoundly influenced. In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City, where she gathered a group of these admirers around her. This group (jokingly designated "The Collective") included future </entity/>Federal-Reserve-Chairman Federal-Reserve-Chairman </entity/>Alan-Greenspan Alan-Greenspan, a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal (later </entity/>Nathaniel-Branden Nathaniel-Branden) and his wife </entity/>Barbara-Branden </mention/>Barbara, and Barbara's cousin </entity/>Leonard-Peikoff Leonard-Peikoff. At first the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand on weekends at her apartment to discuss philosophy. Later she began allowing them to read the drafts of her new novel, "Atlas Shrugged", as the manuscript pages were written. In 1954 Rand's close relationship with the younger Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair, with the consent of their spouses.
"Atlas Shrugged", published in 1957, was considered Rand's "</entity/>magnum-opus magnum-opus". Rand described the theme of the novel as "the role of the mind in man's existence—and, as a corollary, the demonstration of a new moral philosophy: the morality of rational self-interest." It advocates the core tenets of Rand's philosophy of </entity/>Objectivism-(Ayn-Rand) </mention/>Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement. The plot involves a </entity/>dystopia dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists, scientists, and artists go on </entity/>strike-action </mention/>strike and retreat to a mountainous hideaway where they build an independent free economy. The novel's hero and leader of the strike, </entity/>John-Galt John-Galt, describes the strike as "stopping the motor of the world" by withdrawing the minds of the individuals most contributing to the nation's wealth and achievement. With this fictional strike, Rand intended to illustrate that without the efforts of the rational and productive, the economy would collapse and society would fall apart. The novel includes elements of </entity/>Romance-novel </mention/>romance, </entity/>mystery-(fiction) </mention/>mystery, and </entity/>science-fiction science-fiction, and it contains Rand's most extensive statement of Objectivism in any of her works of fiction, a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt.
Despite many negative reviews, "Atlas Shrugged" became an international bestseller, and in an interview with </entity/>Mike-Wallace-(journalist) </mention/>Mike-Wallace, Rand declared herself "the most creative thinker alive". After completing the novel, Rand fell into a severe depression. "Atlas Shrugged" was Rand's last completed work of fiction; a turning point in her life, it marked the end of Rand's career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher.
In 1958 Nathaniel Branden established Nathaniel Branden Lectures, later incorporated as the </entity/>Nathaniel-Branden-Institute Nathaniel-Branden-Institute (NBI), to promote Rand's philosophy. Collective members gave lectures for NBI and wrote articles for </entity/>Objectivist-periodicals Objectivist-periodicals that she edited. Rand later published some of these articles in book form. Critics, including some former NBI students and Branden himself, have described the culture of NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand, with some describing NBI or the </entity/>Objectivist-movement Objectivist-movement itself as a </entity/>cult cult or religion. Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics, from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair, and some of her followers mimicked her preferences, wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers. Rand was unimpressed with many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards, sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her. However, some former NBI students believe the extent of these behaviors has been exaggerated, with the problem being concentrated among Rand's closest followers in New York.
Later years.
Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at institutions such as </entity/>Yale Yale, </entity/>Princeton-University </mention/>Princeton, </entity/>Columbia-University </mention/>Columbia, </entity/>Harvard Harvard, and </entity/>MIT MIT. She received an honorary doctorate from </entity/>Lewis-&-Clark-College Lewis-&-Clark-College in 1963. She also began delivering annual lectures at the </entity/>Ford-Hall-Forum Ford-Hall-Forum, responding afterward to questions from the audience. During these speeches and Q&A sessions, she often took controversial stances on political and social issues of the day. These included supporting abortion rights, opposing the </entity/>Vietnam-War Vietnam-War and the </entity/>military-draft military-draft (but condemning many </entity/>draft-dodgers draft-dodgers as "bums"), supporting </entity/>Israel Israel in the </entity/>Yom-Kippur-War Yom-Kippur-War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as "civilized men fighting savages", saying </entity/>European-colonization-of-the-Americas </mention/>European-colonists had the right to take land from </entity/>Indigenous-peoples-of-the-Americas </mention/>American-Indians, and calling </entity/>homosexuality homosexuality "immoral" and "disgusting", while also advocating the repeal of all laws about it. She also endorsed several </entity/>Republican-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Republican candidates for President of the United States, most strongly </entity/>Barry-Goldwater Barry-Goldwater in </entity/>United-States-presidential-election,-1964 </mention/>1964, whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for "The Objectivist Newsletter".
</entity/>
In 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott, whom he later married. Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand. When she learned of it in 1968, though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended, Rand terminated her relationship with both Brandens, which led to the closure of NBI. Rand published an article in "The Objectivist" repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other "irrational behavior in his private life". Branden later apologized in an interview to "every student of Objectivism" for "perpetuating the Ayn Rand mystique" and for "contributing to that dreadful atmosphere of intellectual repressiveness that pervades the Objectivist movement." In subsequent years, Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company.
Rand underwent surgery for </entity/>lung-cancer lung-cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking.
In 1976, she retired from writing her newsletter and, despite her initial objections, allowed Evva Pryor, a social worker from her attorney's office, to enroll her in </entity/>Social-Security-(United-States) </mention/>Social-Security and </entity/>Medicare-(United-States) </mention/>Medicare. During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined, especially after the death of her husband on November 9, 1979. One of her final projects was work on a never-completed television adaptation of "Atlas Shrugged".
Rand died of </entity/>heart-failure heart-failure on March 6, 1982, at her home in New York City, and was interred in the </entity/>Kensico-Cemetery Kensico-Cemetery, </entity/>Valhalla,-New-York Valhalla,-New-York. Rand's funeral was attended by some of her prominent followers, including </entity/>Alan-Greenspan Alan-Greenspan. A floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket. In her will, Rand named </entity/>Leonard-Peikoff Leonard-Peikoff the heir to her estate.
Philosophy.
Rand called her philosophy "Objectivism", describing its essence as "the concept of man as a heroic being, with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life, with productive achievement as his noblest activity, and reason as his only absolute." She considered Objectivism a </entity/>systematic-philosophy systematic-philosophy and laid out positions on </entity/>metaphysics metaphysics, </entity/>epistemology epistemology, </entity/>ethics ethics, </entity/>political-philosophy political-philosophy and </entity/>aesthetics aesthetics.
In metaphysics, Rand supported </entity/>philosophical-realism philosophical-realism, and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism, including all forms of religion. In </entity/>epistemology epistemology, she considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception, the validity of which she considered </entity/>axiom axiomatic, and </entity/>reason reason, which she described as "the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by man's senses." She rejected all claims of non-perceptual or "</entity/>A-priori-and-a-posteriori </mention/>a-priori" knowledge, including "'instinct,' 'intuition,' 'revelation,' or any form of 'just knowing. In her "</entity/>Introduction-to-Objectivist-Epistemology Introduction-to-Objectivist-Epistemology", Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the </entity/>analytic–synthetic-dichotomy analytic–synthetic-dichotomy.
In ethics, Rand argued for </entity/>rational-egoism </mention/>rational and </entity/>ethical-egoism ethical-egoism (rational self-interest), as the guiding moral principle. She said the individual should "exist for his own sake, neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself." She referred to egoism as "the virtue of selfishness" in her </entity/>The-Virtue-of-Selfishness </mention/>book-of-that-title, in which she presented her solution to the </entity/>is-ought-problem is-ought-problem by describing a </entity/>meta-ethical meta-ethical theory that based morality in the needs of "man's survival "qua" man". She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness, and held that the </entity/>initiation-of-force initiation-of-force was evil and irrational, writing in "Atlas Shrugged" that "Force and mind are opposites."
Rand's political philosophy emphasized </entity/>individual-rights individual-rights (including </entity/>Private-property </mention/>property-rights), and she considered "</entity/>laissez-faire laissez-faire" </entity/>capitalism capitalism the only moral social system because in her view it was the only system based on the protection of those rights. She opposed </entity/>statism statism, which she understood to include </entity/>theocracy theocracy, </entity/>absolute-monarchy absolute-monarchy, </entity/>Nazism Nazism, </entity/>fascism fascism, </entity/>communism communism, </entity/>democratic-socialism democratic-socialism, and </entity/>dictatorship dictatorship. Rand believed that rights should be enforced by a constitutionally limited government. Although her political views are often classified as </entity/>Conservatism-in-the-United-States </mention/>conservative or </entity/>libertarian libertarian, she preferred the term "radical for capitalism". She worked with conservatives on political projects, but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics. She denounced libertarianism, which she associated with </entity/>anarchism anarchism. She rejected anarchism as a naïve theory based in </entity/>subjectivism subjectivism that could only lead to collectivism in practice.
Rand's aesthetics defined art as a "selective re-creation of reality according to an artist's metaphysical value-judgments." According to Rand, art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be easily grasped, thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness. As a writer, the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature, where she considered </entity/>romanticism romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human </entity/>free-will free-will. She described her own approach to literature as "</entity/>romantic-realism romantic-realism".
Rand acknowledged </entity/>Aristotle Aristotle as her greatest influence and remarked that in the </entity/>history-of-philosophy history-of-philosophy she could only recommend "three A's"—Aristotle, </entity/>Aquinas Aquinas, and Ayn Rand. In a 1959 interview with </entity/>Mike-Wallace-(journalist) </mention/>Mike-Wallace, when asked where her philosophy came from, she responded, "Out of my own mind, with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle, the only philosopher who ever influenced me. I devised the rest of my philosophy myself." However, she also found early inspiration in </entity/>Friedrich-Nietzsche Friedrich-Nietzsche, and scholars have found indications of his influence in early notes from Rand's journals, in passages from the first edition of "We the Living" (which Rand later revised), and in her overall writing style. However, by the time she wrote "The Fountainhead", Rand had turned against Nietzsche's ideas, and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed. Among the philosophers Rand held in particular disdain was </entity/>Immanuel-Kant Immanuel-Kant, whom she referred to as a "monster", although philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued that she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences.
Rand said her most important contributions to philosophy were her "theory of concepts, [her] ethics, and [her] discovery in politics that evil—the violation of rights—consists of the initiation of force." She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy, stating, "I am not "primarily" an advocate of capitalism, but of egoism; and I am not "primarily" an advocate of egoism, but of reason. If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows."
Reception and legacy.
Reviews.
During Rand's lifetime, her work evoked both extreme praise and condemnation. Rand's first novel, "We the Living", was admired by the literary critic </entity/>H.-L.-Mencken H.-L.-Mencken, her Broadway play "Night of January 16th" was both a critical and popular success, and "The Fountainhead" was hailed by a reviewer in "</entity/>The-New-York-Times The-New-York-Times" as "masterful". Rand's novels were derided by some critics when they were first published as being long and melodramatic. However, they became </entity/>bestseller bestsellers largely through word of mouth.
The first reviews Rand received were for "Night of January 16th". Reviews of the production were largely positive, but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing because of significant changes made to her script by the producer. Rand believed that her first novel, "We the Living", was not widely reviewed, but Rand scholar Michael S. Berliner says "it was the most reviewed of any of her works", with approximately 125 different reviews being published in more than 200 publications. Overall these reviews were more positive than the reviews she received for her later work. Her 1938 novella "Anthem" received little attention from reviewers, both for its first publication in England and for subsequent re-issues.
Rand's first bestseller, "The Fountainhead", received far fewer reviews than "We the Living", and reviewers' opinions were mixed. There was a positive review in "The New York Times" that Rand greatly appreciated. The reviewer called Rand "a writer of great power" who wrote "brilliantly, beautifully and bitterly", and stated that "you will not be able to read this masterful book without thinking through some of the basic concepts of our time". There were other positive reviews, but Rand dismissed most of them as either not understanding her message or as being from unimportant publications. Some negative reviews focused on the length of the novel, such as one that called it "a whale of a book" and another that said "anyone who is taken in by it deserves a stern lecture on paper-rationing". Other negative reviews called the characters unsympathetic and Rand's style "offensively pedestrian".
Rand's 1957 novel "Atlas Shrugged" was widely reviewed, and many of the reviews were strongly negative. In the "</entity/>National-Review National-Review", conservative author </entity/>Whittaker-Chambers Whittaker-Chambers called the book "sophomoric" and "remarkably silly". He described the tone of the book as "shrillness without reprieve" and accused Rand of supporting a godless system (which he related to that of the </entity/>Religion-in-the-Soviet-Union </mention/>Soviets), claiming "From almost any page of "Atlas Shrugged", a voice can be heard, from painful necessity, commanding: 'To a gas chamber—go! "Atlas Shrugged" received positive reviews from a few publications, including praise from the noted book reviewer </entity/>John-Chamberlain-(journalist) </mention/>John-Chamberlain, but Rand scholar </entity/>Mimi-Reisel-Gladstein Mimi-Reisel-Gladstein later wrote that "reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest put-downs", calling it "execrable claptrap" and "a nightmare"; they said it was "written out of hate" and showed "remorseless hectoring and prolixity". Author </entity/>Flannery-O'Connor Flannery-O'Connor wrote in a letter to a friend that "The fiction of Ayn Rand is as low as you can get re fiction. I hope you picked it up off the floor of the subway and threw it in the nearest garbage pail."
Rand's nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels had. The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book, "</entity/>For-the-New-Intellectual For-the-New-Intellectual", was similar to that for "Atlas Shrugged", with philosopher </entity/>Sidney-Hook Sidney-Hook likening her certainty to "the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union", and author </entity/>Gore-Vidal Gore-Vidal calling her viewpoint "nearly perfect in its immorality". Her subsequent books got progressively less attention from reviewers.
On the 100th anniversary of Rand's birth in 2005, Edward Rothstein, writing for "The New York Times", referred to her fictional writing as quaint </entity/>utopian utopian "retro fantasy" and programmatic </entity/>neo-Romanticism neo-Romanticism of the misunderstood artist, while criticizing her characters' "isolated rejection of democratic society". In 2007, book critic Leslie Clark described her fiction as "romance novels with a patina of </entity/>pseudo-philosophy pseudo-philosophy". In 2009, "</entity/>GQ GQ"s critic columnist Tom Carson described her books as "capitalism's version of middlebrow religious novels" such as "</entity/>" and the "</entity/>Left-Behind Left-Behind" series.
Popular interest.
</entity/>
In 1991, a survey conducted for the </entity/>Library-of-Congress Library-of-Congress and the </entity/>Book-of-the-Month-Club Book-of-the-Month-Club asked club members what the most influential book in the respondent's life was. Rand's "Atlas Shrugged" was the second most popular choice, after the </entity/>Bible Bible. Rand's books continue to be widely sold and read, with over 29 million copies sold as of 2013 (with about 10% of that total purchased for free distribution to schools by the </entity/>Ayn-Rand-Institute Ayn-Rand-Institute). Although Rand's influence has been greatest in the United States, there has been international interest in her work. Rand's work continues to be among the top sellers among books in India.
Rand's contemporary admirers included fellow novelists, such as </entity/>Ira-Levin Ira-Levin, </entity/>Kay-Nolte-Smith Kay-Nolte-Smith and </entity/>L.-Neil-Smith L.-Neil-Smith, and later writers such as </entity/>Erika-Holzer Erika-Holzer and </entity/>Terry-Goodkind Terry-Goodkind have been influenced by her. Other artists who have cited Rand as an important influence on their lives and thought include </entity/>comic-book comic-book artist </entity/>Steve-Ditko Steve-Ditko and musician </entity/>Neil-Peart Neil-Peart of </entity/>Rush-(band) </mention/>Rush. Rand provided a positive view of business, and in response business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work. </entity/>John-A.-Allison-IV </mention/>John-Allison of BB&T and </entity/>Ed-Snider Ed-Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rand's ideas, while </entity/>Mark-Cuban Mark-Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks, and </entity/>John-P.-Mackey John-P.-Mackey, CEO of Whole Foods, among others, have said they consider Rand crucial to their success.
Rand and her works have been referred to in a variety of media: on television shows including animated sitcoms, live-action comedies, dramas, and game shows, as well as in movies and video games. She, or characters based on her, figure prominently (in positive and negative lights) in literary and science fiction novels by prominent American authors. </entity/>Nick-Gillespie Nick-Gillespie, editor in chief of "</entity/>Reason-(magazine) </mention/>Reason", has remarked that "Rand's is a tortured immortality, one in which she's as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist..." and that "jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman, run through the popular culture". Two movies have been made about Rand's life. A 1997 documentary film, "</entity/>", was nominated for the </entity/>Academy-Award-for-Documentary-Feature Academy-Award-for-Documentary-Feature. "</entity/>The-Passion-of-Ayn-Rand-(film) </mention/>The-Passion-of-Ayn-Rand", a 1999 television adaptation of the </entity/>The-Passion-of-Ayn-Rand-(book) </mention/>book-of-the-same-name, won several awards. Rand's image also appears on a </entity/>Postage-stamps-and-postal-history-of-the-United-States </mention/>U.S.-postage-stamp designed by artist </entity/>Nick-Gaetano Nick-Gaetano.
Political influence.
Although she rejected the labels "</entity/>Conservatism-in-the-United-States </mention/>conservative" and "</entity/>libertarian libertarian", Rand has had continuing influence on </entity/>right-wing-politics right-wing-politics and libertarianism. </entity/>Jim-Powell-(historian) </mention/>Jim-Powell, a senior fellow at the </entity/>Cato-Institute Cato-Institute, considers Rand one of the three most important women (along with </entity/>Rose-Wilder-Lane Rose-Wilder-Lane and </entity/>Isabel-Paterson Isabel-Paterson) of modern </entity/>American-libertarianism American-libertarianism, and </entity/>David-Nolan-(libertarian) </mention/>David-Nolan, one of the founders of the </entity/>Libertarian-Party-(United-States) </mention/>Libertarian-Party, stated that "without Ayn Rand, the libertarian movement would not exist". In his history of the </entity/>libertarian-movement libertarian-movement, journalist </entity/>Brian-Doherty-(journalist) </mention/>Brian-Doherty described her as "the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large", and biographer Jennifer Burns referred to her as "the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right".
</entity/>
She faced intense opposition from </entity/>William-F.-Buckley,-Jr. William-F.-Buckley,-Jr. and other contributors for the "</entity/>National-Review National-Review" magazine. They published numerous criticisms in the 1950s and 1960s by </entity/>Whittaker-Chambers Whittaker-Chambers, </entity/>Garry-Wills Garry-Wills, and </entity/>M.-Stanton-Evans M.-Stanton-Evans. Nevertheless, her influence among conservatives forced Buckley and other "National Review" contributors to reconsider how traditional notions of virtue and Christianity could be integrated with support for capitalism.
The political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives (often members of the United States Republican Party), despite Rand taking some positions that are atypical for conservatives, such as being </entity/>pro-choice pro-choice and an atheist. A 1987 article in "</entity/>The-New-York-Times The-New-York-Times" referred to her as the </entity/>Reagan-administration Reagan-administration's "novelist laureate". Republican </entity/>United-States-Congress </mention/>Congressmen and conservative </entity/>pundits pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and recommended her novels.
The </entity/>late-2000s-financial-crisis late-2000s-financial-crisis spurred renewed interest in her works, especially "Atlas Shrugged", which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis, and opinion articles compared real-world events with the plot of the novel. During this time, signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero </entity/>John-Galt John-Galt appeared at </entity/>Tea-Party-protests Tea-Party-protests. There was also increased criticism of her ideas, especially from the </entity/>political-left political-left, with critics blaming the economic crisis on her support of </entity/>Rational-egoism </mention/>selfishness and </entity/>free-markets free-markets, particularly through her influence on </entity/>Alan-Greenspan Alan-Greenspan. For example, "</entity/>Mother-Jones-(magazine) </mention/>Mother-Jones" remarked that "Rand's particular genius has always been her ability to turn upside down traditional hierarchies and recast the wealthy, the talented, and the powerful as the oppressed", while "</entity/>The-Nation The-Nation" alleged similarities between the "moral syntax of Randianism" and fascism.
Academic reaction.
During Rand's lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars. When the first academic book about Rand's philosophy appeared in 1971, its author declared writing about Rand "a treacherous undertaking" that could lead to "guilt by association" for taking her seriously. A few articles about Rand's ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982, many of them in "</entity/>The-Personalist The-Personalist". One of these was "On the Randian Argument" by libertarian philosopher </entity/>Robert-Nozick Robert-Nozick, who argued that her </entity/>meta-ethical meta-ethical argument is unsound and fails to solve the </entity/>is–ought-problem is–ought-problem posed by </entity/>David-Hume David-Hume. Some responses to Nozick by other academic philosophers were also published in "The Personalist" arguing that Nozick misstated Rand's case. Academic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited. Academic Mimi Gladstein was unable to find any scholarly articles about Rand's novels when she began researching her in 1973, and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s.
Since Rand's death, interest in her work has gradually increased. Historian Jennifer Burns has identified "three overlapping waves" of scholarly interest in Rand, the most recent of which is "an explosion of scholarship" since the year 2000. However, few universities currently include Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area, with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study.
Gladstein, </entity/>Chris-Matthew-Sciabarra Chris-Matthew-Sciabarra, </entity/>Allan-Gotthelf Allan-Gotthelf, </entity/>Edwin-A.-Locke Edwin-A.-Locke and </entity/>Tara-Smith-(philosopher) </mention/>Tara-Smith have taught her work in academic institutions. Sciabarra co-edits the "</entity/>Journal-of-Ayn-Rand-Studies Journal-of-Ayn-Rand-Studies", a nonpartisan </entity/>peer-reviewed-journal peer-reviewed-journal dedicated to the study of Rand's philosophical and literary work. In 1987 Gotthelf helped found the Ayn Rand Society with George Walsh and David Kelley, and has been active in sponsoring seminars about Rand and her ideas. Smith has written several academic books and papers on Rand's ideas, including "Ayn Rand's Normative Ethics: The Virtuous Egoist", a volume on Rand's ethical theory published by </entity/>Cambridge-University-Press Cambridge-University-Press. Rand's ideas have also been made subjects of study at </entity/>Clemson-University </mention/>Clemson and </entity/>Duke-University </mention/>Duke universities. Scholars of English and American literature have largely ignored her work, although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s.
Rand scholars Douglas Den Uyl and </entity/>Douglas-B.-Rasmussen Douglas-B.-Rasmussen, while stressing the importance and originality of her thought, describe her style as "literary, hyperbolic and emotional". Philosopher Jack Wheeler says that despite "the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage", Rand's ethics are "a most immense achievement, the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought." In the "</entity/>The-Literary-Encyclopedia-(English) </mention/>Literary-Encyclopedia" entry for Rand written in 2001, </entity/>John-David-Lewis John-David-Lewis declared that "Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation". In a 1999 interview in the "</entity/>Chronicle-of-Higher-Education Chronicle-of-Higher-Education", Sciabarra commented, "I know they laugh at Rand", while forecasting a growth of interest in her work in the academic community.
Libertarian philosopher </entity/>Michael-Huemer Michael-Huemer has argued that very few people find Rand's ideas convincing, especially her ethics, which he believes is difficult to interpret and may lack logical coherence. He attributes the attention she receives to her being a "compelling writer", especially as a novelist. Thus, "Atlas Shrugged" outsells not only the works of other philosophers of </entity/>classical-liberalism classical-liberalism such as </entity/>Ludwig-von-Mises Ludwig-von-Mises, </entity/>Friedrich-Hayek Friedrich-Hayek, or </entity/>Frederic-Bastiat Frederic-Bastiat, but also Rand's own non-fiction works.
Political scientist </entity/>Charles-Murray-(author) </mention/>Charles-Murray, while praising Rand's literary accomplishments, criticizes her claim that her only "philosophical debt" was to Aristotle, instead asserting that her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as </entity/>John-Locke John-Locke and </entity/>Friedrich-Nietzsche Friedrich-Nietzsche.
Although Rand maintained that Objectivism was an integrated philosophical system, philosopher Robert H. Bass has argued that her central ethical ideas are inconsistent and contradictory to her central political ideas.
Objectivist movement.
In 1985, Rand's heir Leonard Peikoff established the </entity/>Ayn-Rand-Institute Ayn-Rand-Institute, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas and works. In 1990, philosopher </entity/>David-Kelley David-Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies, now known as </entity/>The-Atlas-Society The-Atlas-Society. In 2001 historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship, which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia. The charitable foundation of </entity/>BB&T-Corporation BB&T-Corporation has also given grants for teaching Rand's ideas or works. The </entity/>University-of-Texas-at-Austin University-of-Texas-at-Austin, the </entity/>University-of-Pittsburgh University-of-Pittsburgh, and </entity/>University-of-North-Carolina-at-Chapel-Hill University-of-North-Carolina-at-Chapel-Hill are among the schools that have received grants. In some cases these grants have been controversial due to their requiring research or teaching related to Rand.

Algeria

Algeria ( or ; </entity/>Literary-Arabic Literary-Arabic: '; </entity/>Algerian-Arabic Algerian-Arabic,</entity/>Berber-languages </mention/>Tamazight: "Dzayer," ⴷⵣⴰⵢⴻⵔ; ), officially People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a country in the </entity/>Maghreb Maghreb region of </entity/>North-Africa North-Africa on the </entity/>Mediterranean-Sea </mention/>Mediterranean-coast. Its capital and most populous city is </entity/>Algiers Algiers. With a total area of , 90% of which is desert, Algeria is the </entity/>List-of-countries-and-dependencies-by-area </mention/>tenth-largest-country-in-the-world, and the largest in Africa and in the Mediterranean. The country is bordered in the northeast by </entity/>Tunisia Tunisia, in the east by </entity/>Libya Libya, in the west by </entity/>Morocco Morocco, in the southwest by </entity/>Western-Sahara Western-Sahara, </entity/>Mauritania Mauritania, and </entity/>Mali Mali, in the southeast by </entity/>Niger Niger, and in the north by the </entity/>Mediterranean-Sea Mediterranean-Sea.
The territory of today's Algeria was the home of many prehistoric cultures, including </entity/>Aterian Aterian and </entity/>Capsian-culture </mention/>Capsian and the </entity/>Proto-Berber-language </mention/>"Proto-Imaziɣen" cultures. Its area has known many empires and dynasties, including ancient </entity/>Berber-people </mention/>Amaziɣ </entity/>Numidia Numidians, </entity/>Phoenecians Phoenecians, Lybio-Punic </entity/>Punic </mention/>Carthaginians, </entity/>Ancient-Rome </mention/>Romans, </entity/>Vandals Vandals, </entity/>Byzantine-Empire </mention/>Byzantines, Arab </entity/>Umayyad Umayyads, Arab </entity/>Abbasid Abbasids, Multi-Ethnic </entity/>Fatimid Fatimids, </entity/>Berber-people </mention/>Amaziɣ </entity/>Hammadids Hammadids, </entity/>Berber-people </mention/>Amaziɣ </entity/>Almoravids Almoravids, </entity/>Berber-people </mention/>Amaziɣ </entity/>Almohads Almohads, </entity/>Ottoman-Turks </mention/>Turkish Ottomans and the </entity/>French-Algeria </mention/>French-colonial-empire. In recent decades Algeria along with the other nations of the "Desert Belt" has experienced an identity crisis, in response Algeria, along with Morocco, has nationalized </entity/>Tamaziɣt Tamaziɣt the language of its 13,000 year old people. Algeria is a </entity/>Semi-presidential-system </mention/>semi-presidential-republic, it consists of 48 provinces and 1541 communes. With a population of 37.9 million, it is the 35th most populated country on Earth. </entity/>Abdelaziz-Bouteflika Abdelaziz-Bouteflika has been the </entity/>President-of-Algeria President-of-Algeria since 1999 and has won four consecutive elections. However, according to the </entity/>Democracy-Index Democracy-Index Algeria is an </entity/>authoritarian-regime authoritarian-regime.
Algeria's economy is largely based on </entity/>hydrocarbons hydrocarbons, due to which manufacturing has suffered from </entity/>Dutch-disease Dutch-disease. The country supplies large amounts of </entity/>natural-gas natural-gas to Europe and energy exports are the backbone of the economy. According to </entity/>OPEC OPEC Algeria has </entity/>List-of-countries-by-proven-oil-reserves </mention/>17th-largest reserves of oil in the world, and second largest in </entity/>Africa Africa, while it has the </entity/>List-of-countries-by-natural-gas-proven-reserves </mention/>9th-largest-reserves of </entity/>natural-gas natural-gas. </entity/>Sonatrach Sonatrach, the national oil company, is the largest company in Africa.
Algeria has the </entity/>List-of-countries-by-number-of-military-and-paramilitary-personnel </mention/>second-largest-military in North Africa with the largest defense budget in Africa. Algeria has had a peaceful </entity/>Algeria-and-weapons-of-mass-destruction </mention/>nuclear-program since the 1990s. Algeria is a member of the </entity/>African-Union African-Union, the </entity/>Arab-League Arab-League, </entity/>OPEC OPEC and the United Nations, and is a founding member of the </entity/>Arab-Maghreb-Union Arab-Maghreb-Union.
Etymology.
The country's name derives from the city of </entity/>Algiers Algiers. The city's name in turn derives from the Arabic "al-Jazā'ir" (الجزائر, "The Islands"), a truncated form of the older "Jazā'ir Banī Mazghanna" (جزائر بني مزغنة, "Islands of the Mazghanna Tribe"), employed by medieval geographers such as </entity/>Muhammad-al-Idrisi </mention/>al-Idrisi.
History.
Ancient history.
</entity/>
In the region of Ain Hanech (</entity/>Saïda-Province Saïda-Province), early remnants (200,000 BC) of hominid occupation in North Africa were found. Neanderthal tool makers produced hand axes in the </entity/>Levallois-technique </mention/>Levalloisian and </entity/>Mousterian Mousterian styles (43,000 BC) similar to those in the </entity/>Levant Levant.
Algeria was the site of the highest state of development of </entity/>Middle-Paleolithic Middle-Paleolithic </entity/>Flake-tool Flake-tool techniques. Tools of this era, starting about 30,000 BC, are called </entity/>Aterian Aterian (after the archeological site of </entity/>Bir-el-Ater Bir-el-Ater, south of </entity/>Tebessa Tebessa).
The earliest blade industries in North Africa are called </entity/>Iberomaurusian Iberomaurusian (located mainly in </entity/>Oran Oran region). This industry appears to have spread throughout the coastal regions of the </entity/>Maghreb Maghreb between 15,000 and 10,000 BC. Neolithic civilization (animal domestication and agriculture) developed in the Saharan and Mediterranean Maghreb perhaps as early as 11,000 BC or as late as between 6000 and 2000 BC. This life, richly depicted in the </entity/>Tassili-n'Ajjer Tassili-n'Ajjer paintings, predominated in Algeria until the classical period.
The amalgam of peoples of North Africa coalesced eventually into a distinct native population that came to be called </entity/>Berber-people </mention/>Berbers, who are the indigenous peoples of northern Africa.
</entity/>
</entity/>
From their principal center of power at Carthage, the </entity/>Carthaginians Carthaginians expanded and established small settlements along the North African coast; by 600 BC, a </entity/>Phoenicia Phoenician presence existed at </entity/>Tipasa Tipasa, east of </entity/>Cherchell Cherchell, </entity/>Hippo-Regius Hippo-Regius (modern </entity/>Annaba Annaba) and </entity/>Rusicade Rusicade (modern </entity/>Skikda Skikda). These settlements served as market towns as well as anchorages.
As Carthaginian power grew, its impact on the indigenous population increased dramatically. Berber civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others.
</entity/>
By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed the single largest element of the Carthaginian army. In the </entity/>Mercenary-War </mention/>Revolt-of-the-Mercenaries, Berber soldiers rebelled from 241 to 238 BC after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the </entity/>First-Punic-War First-Punic-War. They succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the </entity/>Punic-Wars Punic-Wars.
In 146 BC the city of </entity/>Carthage Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in </entity/>Numidia Numidia, behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay </entity/>Mauretania Mauretania, which extended across the </entity/>Moulouya-River Moulouya-River in modern day </entity/>Morocco Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the </entity/>Almohads Almohads and </entity/>Almoravids Almoravids more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of </entity/>Massinissa Massinissa in the 2nd century BC.
After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Massinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the </entity/>Roman-Empire Roman-Empire.
</entity/>
For several centuries Algeria was ruled by the Romans, who founded many colonies in the region. Like the rest of North Africa, Algeria was one of the breadbaskets of the empire, exporting cereals and other agricultural products. The Vandals of </entity/>Geiseric Geiseric moved into North Africa in 429, and by 435 controlled coastal Numidia. They did not make any significant settlement on the land, as they were harassed by local tribes, in fact by the time the Byzantines arrived Lepcis Magna was abandoned and the Msellata region was occupied by the indigenous </entity/>Amazigh </mention/>Laguatan who had been busy facilitating an </entity/>Amazigh </mention/>Amaziɣ political, military and cultural revival.
</entity/>
Middle Ages.
</entity/>
</entity/>
After fierce resistance from the locals the Muslims conquered Algeria in the mid-7th century and a large number of the indigenous people converted to the new faith. After the fall of the </entity/>Umayyad Umayyad Caliphate in 751, numerous local dynasties emerged, including the </entity/>Aghlabids Aghlabids, </entity/>Almohads Almohads, </entity/>Abdalwadid Abdalwadid, </entity/>Zirids Zirids, </entity/>Rustamids Rustamids, </entity/>Hammadids Hammadids, </entity/>Almoravids Almoravids and the </entity/>Fatimids Fatimids.
During the Middle Ages North Africa and Algeria more specifically was home to many great Scholars, Saints and Sovereigns including </entity/>Judah-ibn-Kuraish </mention/>Judah-Ibn-Quryash the first grammarian to suggest the </entity/>Afroasiatic-languages </mention/>Afro-Asiatic-Language-Family the great Sufi masters </entity/>Abu-Madyan </mention/>Sidi-Boumediene-(Abu-Madyan) and </entity/>Sidi-El-Houari Sidi-El-Houari, as well as the Emirs </entity/>Abd-al-Mu'min </mention/>Abd-Al-Mu'min and </entity/>Yaghmurasen-Ibn-Zyan </mention/>Yāghmūrasen. It was during this time period that the </entity/>Fatimids Fatimids or children of Fatima daughter of Muhammad, according to Fatimid claims came to the Maghreb. These "Fatimids" went on to found a long lasting dynasty stretching across the Maghreb, Hejaz, and the Levant, boasting a secular inner government, as well as a powerful army and navy, primarily made of native North Africans, </entity/>Arabs Arabs and </entity/>Levant </mention/>levantians extending from Algeria to their capital state of </entity/>Cairo Cairo. The </entity/>Fatimid-caliphate Fatimid-caliphate began to collapse when it's African governors the </entity/>Zirids Zirids seceded. In order to punish them the Fatimids sent the </entity/>Arab Arab </entity/>Banu-Hilal Banu-Hilal and </entity/>Banu-Sulaym Banu-Sulaym against them. The resultant war is recounted in the epic </entity/>Taghribat-Bani-Hilal </mention/>Tāghribāt. In Al-Tāghrībāt the Amāzīɣ Zirid Hero </entity/>Khalifa-al-Zanati </mention/>Khālīfā-Al-Zānatī asks daily, for duels, defeating the Hilalan hero </entity/>Abu-Zayd-al-Hilali </mention/>Ābu-Zayd-al-Hilalī and many other Arab knights in a string of victories. The </entity/>Zirid Zirids however were unexpectedly defeated ushering in an influx of Arab customs and culture. The Indigenous </entity/>Berber-people </mention/>Imaziɣen tribes however remained largely independent, and depending on tribe, location, and time controlled varying parts of the Maghreb, at times unifying it (as under the Fatimids). The Fatimid Islamic state, also known as </entity/>Fatimid-Caliphate Fatimid-Caliphate made an Islamic empire that included North Africa, Sicily, </entity/>Palestine Palestine, </entity/>Jordan Jordan, </entity/>Lebanon Lebanon, </entity/>Syria Syria, the </entity/>Red-Sea Red-Sea coast of Africa, Tihamah, </entity/>Hejaz Hejaz, and </entity/>Yemen Yemen. Caliphates from Northern Africa traded tit for tat with the other empires of their time, as well as forming part of a confederated support and trade network with other Islamic states during the highly competitive Islamic Era.
The </entity/>Berber-people </mention/>Imaziɣen historically consisted of several tribes. The two main branches were the Botr and Barnès tribes, who were divided into tribes, and again into sub-tribes. Each region of the Maghreb contained several tribes (for example, </entity/>Sanhadja Sanhadja, Houaras, </entity/>Zenata Zenata, </entity/>Masmuda </mention/>Masmouda, Kutama, Awarba, and </entity/>Berghwata Berghwata). All these tribes made independent territorial decisions.
Several </entity/>Berber-people </mention/>Imaziɣen dynasties emerged during the Middle Ages in the Maghreb and other nearby lands. </entity/>Ibn-Khaldun Ibn-Khaldun provides a table summarizing the </entity/>Berber-people </mention/>Imaziɣen dynasties of the Maghreb region, the Zirid, </entity/>Banu-Ifran Banu-Ifran, </entity/>Maghrawa Maghrawa, </entity/>Almoravid Almoravid, </entity/>Hammadid Hammadid, </entity/>Almohad Almohad, </entity/>Merinid Merinid, Abdalwadid, </entity/>Wattasid Wattasid, </entity/>Meknassa Meknassa and </entity/>Hafsid Hafsid dynasties.
In the early 16th century, Spain constructed fortified outposts (</entity/>presidio presidios) on or near the Algerian coast. Spain took control of </entity/>Mers-el-Kebir Mers-el-Kebir in 1505; </entity/>Oran Oran in 1509; and </entity/>Tlemcen Tlemcen, </entity/>Mostaganem Mostaganem, and </entity/>Ténès Ténès, in 1510. In the same year, the merchants of Algiers ceded one of the rocky islets in their harbor to Spain, which built a fort on it. The presidios in North Africa turned out to be a costly and largely ineffective military endeavor that did not guarantee access for Spain's merchant fleet.
Ottoman Algeria.
</entity/>
</entity/>
In 1516 the </entity/>Turkic-peoples </mention/>Turk Muslim privateer brothers </entity/>Aruj Aruj and </entity/>Hayreddin-Barbarossa Hayreddin-Barbarossa, who operated successfully under the </entity/>Hafsids Hafsids, moved their base of operations to Algiers. They succeeded in liberating Jijel and Algiers from the </entity/>Spaniards Spaniards but eventually assumed control over the city and the surrounding region, forcing the previous ruler, Abu Hamo Musa III of the "Bani Ziyad" dynasty, to flee. When Aruj was killed in 1518 during his invasion of </entity/>Kingdom-of-Tlemcen </mention/>Tlemcen, Hayreddin succeeded him as military commander of Algiers. The </entity/>Ottoman-Empire </mention/>Ottoman sultan gave him the title of </entity/>beylerbey beylerbey and a contingent of some 2,000 </entity/>janissaries janissaries. With the aid of this force, Hayreddin sub-dued the coastal region between Constantine and Oran (although the city of Oran remained in Spanish hands until 1791).
The next beylerbey was Hayreddin's son </entity/>Hasan-Pasha-(son-of-Barbarossa) </mention/>Hasan, who assumed the position in 1544. Until 1587 the area was governed by officers who served terms with no fixed limits. Subsequently, with the institution of a regular Ottoman administration, governors with the title of pasha ruled for three-year terms. The pasha was assisted by janissaries, known in Algeria as the ojaq and led by an </entity/>Agha-(Ottoman-Empire) </mention/>agha. Discontent among the ojaq rose in the mid-1600s because they were not paid regularly, and they repeatedly revolted against the pasha. As a result, the agha charged the pasha with corruption and incompetence and seized power in 1659.
</entity/>Plague-(disease) </mention/>Plague had repeatedly struck the cities of North Africa. Algiers lost from 30,000 to 50,000 inhabitants to the plague in 1620–21, and suffered high fatalities in 1654–57, 1665, 1691, and 1740–42.
In 1671, the </entity/>taifa taifa rebelled, killed the agha, and placed one of its own in power. The new leader received the title of </entity/>dey dey. After 1689, the right to select the dey passed to the </entity/>divan divan, a council of some sixty notables. It was at first dominated by the "</entity/>ojaq ojaq"; but by the 18th century, it had become the dey's instrument. In 1710, the dey persuaded the sultan to recognize him and his successors as regent, replacing the </entity/>pasha pasha in that role. Although Algiers remained a part of the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government ceased to have effective influence there.
The dey was in effect a constitutional autocrat. The dey was elected for a life term, but in the 159 years (1671–1830) that the system survived, fourteen of the twenty-nine deys were assassinated. Despite usurpation, military coups, and occasional mob rule, the day-to-day operation of government was remarkably orderly. Although the regency patronized the tribal chieftains, it never had the unanimous allegiance of the countryside, where heavy taxation frequently provoked unrest. Autonomous tribal states were tolerated, and the regency's authority was seldom applied in the </entity/>Kabylie Kabylie.
Privateers era.
</entity/>
The </entity/>Barbary-pirates Barbary-pirates preyed on Christian and other non-Islamic shipping in the western Mediterranean Sea. The pirates often took the passengers and crew on the ships and sold them or used them as </entity/>slavery </mention/>slaves. They also did a brisk business in ransoming some of the captives. According to Robert Davis, from the 16th to 19th century, pirates captured 1 million to 1.25 million Europeans as slaves. They often made raids, called </entity/>Ghazi-(warrior) </mention/>Razzias, on European coastal towns to capture Christian slaves to sell at </entity/>Arab-slave-trade </mention/>slave-markets in North Africa and the </entity/>Ottoman-Empire Ottoman-Empire.
In 1544, Hayreddin captured the island of </entity/>Ischia Ischia, taking 4,000 prisoners, and enslaved some 9,000 inhabitants of </entity/>Lipari Lipari, almost the entire population. In 1551, </entity/>Turgut-Reis Turgut-Reis enslaved the entire population of the Maltese island of </entity/>Gozo Gozo, between 5,000 and 6,000, sending the captives to Libya. In 1554, pirates sacked </entity/>Vieste Vieste in southern Italy and took an estimated 7,000 captives as slaves.
In 1558, Barbary corsairs captured the town of </entity/>Ciutadella Ciutadella (Minorca), destroyed it, slaughtered the inhabitants and took 3,000 survivors as slaves to </entity/>Istanbul Istanbul. Barbary pirates often attacked the </entity/>Balearic-Islands Balearic-Islands, and in response, the residents built many coastal watchtowers and fortified churches. The threat was so severe that residents abandoned the island of </entity/>Formentera Formentera.
Between 1609 to 1616, England lost 466 merchant ships to Barbary pirates. In the 19th century, the pirates forged affiliations with Caribbean powers, paying a "license tax" in exchange for safe harbor of their vessels. One American slave reported that the Algerians had enslaved 130 American seamen in the Mediterranean and Atlantic from 1785 to 1793.
Piracy on American vessels in the Mediterranean resulted in the United States initiating the </entity/>First-Barbary-War </mention/>First (1801–1805) and </entity/>Second-Barbary-War Second-Barbary-Wars (1815). Following those wars, Algeria was weaker, and Europeans, with an Anglo-Dutch fleet commanded by the British </entity/>Edward-Pellew,-1st-Viscount-Exmouth </mention/>Lord-Exmouth, </entity/>Bombardment-of-Algiers-(1816) </mention/>attacked-Algiers. After a nine-hour bombardment, they obtained a treaty from the Dey that reaffirmed the conditions imposed by </entity/>Stephen-Decatur </mention/>Decatur (US navy) concerning the demands of tributes. In addition, the Dey agreed to end the practice of enslaving Christians.
The French colonisation of Algeria.
</entity/>
On the pretext of </entity/>French-conquest-of-Algeria#The-Fan-Affair </mention/>a-slight-to-their-consul, the French invaded and captured Algiers in 1830. The conquest of Algeria by the French took some time and resulted in considerable bloodshed. A combination of violence and disease epidemics caused the </entity/>indigenous-peoples </mention/>indigenous Algerian population to decline by nearly one-third from 1830 to 1872. The population of Algeria, which stood at about 1.5 million in 1830, reached nearly 11 million in 1960. French policy was predicated on "civilizing" the country. Algeria's social fabric suffered during the occupation: literacy plummeted. During this period, a small but influential French-speaking indigenous elite was formed, made up of Berbers mostly from </entity/>Kabyle-People </mention/>Kabyles.
As a consequence, French government favored the Kabyles. About 80% of Indigenous Schools were constructed for Kabyles.
</entity/>
From 1848 until independence, France administered the whole Mediterranean region of Algeria as an integral part and département of the nation. One of France's longest-held overseas territories, Algeria became a destination for hundreds of thousands of </entity/>European-ethnic-groups </mention/>European immigrants, who became known as "colons" and later, as "</entity/>Pied-Noir Pied-Noirs." Between 1825 and 1847, 50,000 French people emigrated to Algeria. These settlers benefited from the French government's confiscation of communal land from tribal peoples, and the application of modern agricultural techniques that increased the amount of arable land.
Gradually, dissatisfaction among the Muslim population, which lacked political and economic status in the colonial system, gave rise to demands for greater political autonomy, and eventually independence, from France. Tensions between the two population groups came to a head in 1954, when the first violent events of what was later called the </entity/>Algerian-War Algerian-War began. Historians have estimated that between 30,000 and 150,000 </entity/>Harkis Harkis and their dependents were killed by the </entity/>National-Liberation-Front-(Algeria) </mention/>Front-de-Libération-Nationale (FLN) or by </entity/>lynching </mention/>lynch mobs in Algeria. The FLN used terrorist attacks in Algeria and France as part of its war, and the French conducted severe reprisals and repression. The war concluded in 1962, when Algeria gained complete independence following the March 1962 </entity/>Evian-agreements Evian-agreements and the July 1962 </entity/>Algerian-self-determination-referendum,-1962 </mention/>self-determination-referendum.
Independence.
</entity/>
Algeria's first president was the FLN leader </entity/>Ahmed-Ben-Bella Ahmed-Ben-Bella. Morocco's claim to </entity/>Greater-Morocco </mention/>portions-of-western-Algeria led to the </entity/>Sand-War Sand-War in 1963. Ben Bella was overthrown in 1965 by </entity/>Houari-Boumediene Houari-Boumediene, his former ally and defense minister. Under Ben Bella, the government had become increasingly socialist and </entity/>authoritarianism </mention/>authoritarian; Boumédienne continued this trend. But, he relied much more on the army for his support, and reduced the sole legal party to a symbolic role. He </entity/>collective-farming </mention/>collectivised agriculture and launched a massive industrialization drive. </entity/>Extraction-of-petroleum </mention/>Oil-extraction facilities were nationalized. This was especially beneficial to the leadership after the international </entity/>1973-oil-crisis 1973-oil-crisis.
In the 1960s and 1970s under President Houari Boumediene, Algeria pursued a programme of industrialisation within a state-controlled socialist economy. Boumediene's successor, </entity/>Chadli-Bendjedid Chadli-Bendjedid, introduced some liberal economic reforms. He promoted a policy of </entity/>Arabisation Arabisation in Algerian society and public life. Teachers of Arabic, brought in from other Muslim countries, spread radical Islamic thought in schools and sowed the seeds of political Islamism.
The Algerian economy became increasingly dependent on oil, leading to hardship when the price collapsed during the </entity/>1980s-oil-glut 1980s-oil-glut. Economic recession caused by the crash in world oil prices resulted in Algerian social unrest during the 1980s; by the end of the decade, Bendjedid introduced a multi-party system. Political parties developed, such as the </entity/>Islamic-Salvation-Front Islamic-Salvation-Front (FIS), a broad coalition of Islamist groups.
Civil War and aftermath.
In December 1991 the </entity/>Islamic-Salvation-Front Islamic-Salvation-Front dominated the first of two rounds of </entity/>Algerian-legislative-election,-1991 </mention/>legislative-elections. Fearing the election of an Islamist government, the authorities intervened on 11 January 1992, cancelling the elections. Bendjedid resigned and a </entity/>High-Council-of-State-(Algeria) </mention/>High-Council-of-State was installed to act as Presidency. It banned the FIS, triggering a civil </entity/>insurgency insurgency between the Front's armed wing, the </entity/>Armed-Islamic-Group-of-Algeria </mention/>Armed-Islamic-Group, and the national armed forces, in which more than 100,000 persons are thought to have died. The Islamist militants conducted a violent campaign of </entity/>List-of-massacres-during-the-Algerian-Civil-War </mention/>civilian-massacres. At several points in the conflict, the situation in Algeria became a point of international concern, most notably during the crisis surrounding </entity/>Air-France-Flight-8969 Air-France-Flight-8969, a hijacking perpetrated by the Armed Islamic Group. The Armed Islamic Group declared a ceasefire in October 1997.
Algeria held </entity/>Algerian-presidential-election,-1999 </mention/>elections-in-1999, considered biased by international observers and most opposition groups which were won by President </entity/>Abdelaziz-Bouteflika Abdelaziz-Bouteflika. He worked to restore political stability to the country and announced a 'Civil Concord' initiative, approved in a </entity/>Algerian-Civil-Concord-referendum,-1999 </mention/>referendum, under which many political prisoners were pardoned, and several thousand members of armed groups were granted exemption from prosecution under a limited amnesty, in force until 13 January 2000. The AIS disbanded and levels of insurgent violence fell rapidly. The </entity/>Groupe-Salafiste-pour-la-Prédication-et-le-Combat Groupe-Salafiste-pour-la-Prédication-et-le-Combat (GSPC), a splinter group of the Group Islamic Armée, continued a terrorist campaign against the Government.
</entity/>
Bouteflika was re-elected in the </entity/>Algerian-presidential-election,-2004 </mention/>April-2004-presidential-election after campaigning on a programme of national reconciliation. The programme comprised economic, institutional, political and social reform to modernise the country, raise living standards, and tackle the causes of alienation. It also included a second amnesty initiative, the </entity/>Charter-for-Peace-and-National-Reconciliation Charter-for-Peace-and-National-Reconciliation, which was approved in a </entity/>Algerian-national-reconciliation-referendum,-2005 </mention/>referendum-in-September-2005. It offered amnesty to most guerrillas and Government security forces.
In November 2008, the </entity/>Algerian-Constitution Algerian-Constitution was amended following a vote in Parliament, removing the two-term limit on Presidential incumbents. This change enabled Bouteflika to stand for re-election in the </entity/>Algerian-presidential-election,-2009 </mention/>2009-presidential-elections, and he was re-elected in April 2009. During his election campaign and following his re-election, Bouteflika promised to extend the programme of national reconciliation and a $150-billion spending programme to create three million new jobs, the construction of one million new housing units, and to continue public sector and infrastructure modernisation programmes.
A continuing series of protests throughout the country started on 28 December 2010, inspired by similar </entity/>Arab-Spring </mention/>protests-across-the-Middle-East-and-North-Africa. On 24 February 2011, the government lifted Algeria's 19-year-old </entity/>state-of-emergency state-of-emergency. The government enacted legislation dealing with political parties, the electoral code, and the representation of women in elected bodies. In April 2011, Bouteflika promised further constitutional and political reform. However, elections are routinely criticized by opposition groups as unfair and international human rights groups say that media censorship and harassment of political opponents continue.
Geography.
Algeria is the largest country in Africa, the </entity/>Arab-world Arab-world, and the </entity/>Mediterranean-Basin Mediterranean-Basin. Its southern part includes a significant portion of the </entity/>Sahara Sahara. To the north, the </entity/>Tell-Atlas Tell-Atlas form with the </entity/>Saharan-Atlas Saharan-Atlas, further south, two parallel sets of reliefs in approaching eastbound, and between which are inserted vast plains and highlands. Both Atlas tend to merge in eastern Algeria. The vast mountain ranges of </entity/>Aures Aures and </entity/>Tebessa </mention/>Nememcha occupy the entire northeastern Algeria and are delineated by the Tunisian border. The highest point is </entity/>Mount-Tahat Mount-Tahat ( m).
</entity/>
Algeria lies mostly between latitudes </entity/>19th-parallel-north </mention/>19° and </entity/>37th-parallel-north </mention/>37°N (a small area is north of 37°), and longitudes </entity/>9th-meridian-west </mention/>9°W and </entity/>12th-meridian-east </mention/>12°E. Most of the coastal area is hilly, sometimes even mountainous, and there are a few natural </entity/>harbour harbours. The area from the coast to the Tell Atlas is fertile. South of the Tell Atlas is a </entity/>steppe steppe landscape ending with the </entity/>Saharan-Atlas Saharan-Atlas; farther south, there is the Sahara desert.
The </entity/>Ahaggar-Mountains Ahaggar-Mountains (), also known as the Hoggar, are a highland region in central Sahara, southern Algeria. They are located about south of the capital, Algiers, and just west of </entity/>Tamanghasset Tamanghasset. Algiers, </entity/>Oran Oran, </entity/>Constantine,-Algeria </mention/>Constantine, and </entity/>Annaba Annaba are Algeria's main cities.
Climate and hydrology.
</entity/>
</entity/>
In this region, midday desert temperatures can be hot year round. After sunset, however, the clear, dry air permits rapid loss of heat, and the nights are cool to chilly. Enormous daily ranges in temperature are recorded.
The highest official temperature was at In Salah.
Rainfall is fairly plentiful along the coastal part of the Tell Atlas, ranging from annually, the amount of precipitation increasing from west to east. </entity/>Precipitation-(meteorology) </mention/>Precipitation is heaviest in the northern part of eastern Algeria, where it reaches as much as in some years.
Farther inland, the rainfall is less plentiful. Algeria also has </entity/>erg-(landform) </mention/>ergs, or sand dunes, between mountains. Among these, in the summer time when winds are heavy and gusty, temperatures can get up to .
Fauna and flora.
</entity/>
The varied vegetation of Algeria includes </entity/>coastal coastal, </entity/>mountainous mountainous and grassy </entity/>desert desert-like regions which all support a wide range of wildlife. Many of the creatures comprising the Algerian wildlife live in close proximity to civilization. The most commonly seen animals include the wild </entity/>boar boars, </entity/>jackal jackals, and </entity/>gazelle gazelles, although it is not uncommon to spot </entity/>fennecs fennecs (foxes), and </entity/>jerboas jerboas. Algeria also has a few, </entity/>leopard leopard and </entity/>cheetah cheetah populations, but these are seldom seen.
A variety of bird species makes the country an attraction for bird watchers. The forests are inhabited by boars and jackals. </entity/>Barbary-macaque Barbary-macaques are the sole native monkey. Snakes, </entity/>monitor-lizard monitor-lizards, and numerous other reptiles can be found living among an array of </entity/>rodent rodents throughout the </entity/>semi-arid semi-arid regions of Algeria. Many animals are now extinct, among which the </entity/>Barbary-lion Barbary-lions and bears.
In the north, some of the native flora includes </entity/>Macchia Macchia scrub, </entity/>olive-trees olive-trees, </entity/>oak oaks, </entity/>cedrus </mention/>cedars and other </entity/>conifers conifers. The mountain regions contain large forests of evergreens (</entity/>Aleppo-pine Aleppo-pine, </entity/>juniper juniper, and </entity/>evergreen-oak evergreen-oak) and some deciduous trees. </entity/>Ficus </mention/>Fig, </entity/>eucalyptus eucalyptus, </entity/>agave agave, and various </entity/>palm-trees palm-trees grow in the warmer areas. The </entity/>grape-vine grape-vine is indigenous to the coast. In the Sahara region, some oases have palm trees. </entity/>Acacias Acacias with wild </entity/>olives olives are the predominant flora in the remainder of the </entity/>Sahara Sahara.
</entity/>Camel Camels are used extensively; the desert also abounds with poisonous and nonpoisonous snakes, </entity/>scorpion scorpions, and numerous insects.
Politics.
</entity/>
</entity/>
Algeria is an </entity/>authoritarian-regime authoritarian-regime, according to the </entity/>Democracy-Index Democracy-Index 2010. The </entity/>Freedom-of-the-Press-(report) </mention/>Freedom-of-the-Press-2009 report gives it rating "Not Free".
Elected politicians are considered to have relatively little sway over Algeria. Instead, a group of unelected civilian and military "décideurs", known as "le pouvoir" ("the power"), actually rule the country, even deciding who should be president. The most powerful man may be </entity/>Mohamed-Mediène Mohamed-Mediène, head of the military intelligence. In recent years, many of these generals have died or retired. After the death of General </entity/>Larbi-Belkheir Larbi-Belkheir, Bouteflika put loyalists in key posts, notably at </entity/>Sonatrach Sonatrach, and secured constitutional amendments that make him re-electable indefinitely.
The head of state is the president of Algeria, who is elected for a five-year term. The president was formerly limited to two five-year terms, but a constitutional amendment passed by the Parliament on 11 November 2008 removed this limitation. Algeria has universal </entity/>suffrage suffrage at 18 years of age. The President is the head of the </entity/>Algerian-Army </mention/>army, the </entity/>Council-of-Ministers-of-Algeria </mention/>Council-of-Ministers and the </entity/>High-Security-Council High-Security-Council. He appoints the </entity/>Prime-Minister-of-Algeria </mention/>Prime-Minister who is also the head of government.
The Algerian parliament is </entity/>bicameral bicameral; the lower house, the </entity/>People's-National-Assembly People's-National-Assembly, has 462 members who are directly elected for five-year terms, while the upper house, the </entity/>Council-of-the-Nation Council-of-the-Nation, has 144 members serving six-year terms, of which 96 members are chosen by local assemblies and 48 are appointed by the president. According to the </entity/>Constitution-of-Algeria </mention/>constitution, no political association may be formed if it is "based on differences in religion, language, race, gender, profession or region". In addition, political campaigns must be exempt from the aforementioned subjects.
Parliamentary elections were last held in </entity/>Algerian-legislative-election,-2012 </mention/>May-2012, and were judged to be largely free by international monitors, though local groups alleged fraud and irregularities. In the elections, the </entity/>National-Liberation-Front-(Algeria) </mention/>FLN won 221 seats, the military-backed </entity/>National-Rally-for-Democracy-(Algeria) </mention/>National-Rally-for-Democracy won 70, and the Islamist </entity/>Green-Algeria-Alliance Green-Algeria-Alliance won 47.
Foreign relations.
</entity/>
In October 2009, Algeria cancelled a weapons deal with France over the possibility of inclusion of Israeli parts in them.
Tensions between Algeria and Morocco in relation to the </entity/>Western-Sahara Western-Sahara have been an obstacle to tightening the </entity/>Arab-Maghreb-Union Arab-Maghreb-Union, nominally established in 1989, but which has carried little practical weight.
Algeria is included in the European Union's </entity/>European-Neighbourhood-Policy European-Neighbourhood-Policy (ENP) which aims at bringing the EU and its neighbours closer.
Giving incentives and rewarding best performers, as well as offering funds in a faster and more flexible manner, are the two main principles underlying the European Neighbourhood Instrument (ENI) that came into force in 2014. It has a budget of €15.4 billion and provides the bulk of funding through a number of programmes.
Military.
</entity/>
The military of Algeria consists of the </entity/>People's-National-Army People's-National-Army (ANP), the </entity/>Algerian-National-Navy Algerian-National-Navy (MRA), and the </entity/>Algerian-Air-Force Algerian-Air-Force (QJJ), plus the Territorial Air Defense Force. It is the direct successor of the </entity/>Armée-de-Libération-Nationale Armée-de-Libération-Nationale (ALN), the armed wing of the nationalist National Liberation Front which fought French colonial </entity/>military-occupation </mention/>occupation during the Algerian War of Independence (1954–62).
Total military personnel include 147,000 active, 150,000 reserve, and 187,000 paramilitary staff (2008 estimate). Service in the military is compulsory for men aged 19–30, for a total of 12 months. The military expenditure was 4.3% of the </entity/>gross-domestic-product gross-domestic-product (GDP) in 2012. Algeria has the </entity/>List-of-countries-by-number-of-military-and-paramilitary-personnel </mention/>second-largest-military in North Africa with the largest defense budget in Africa ($10.3 billion).
In 2007, the Algerian Air Force signed a deal with Russia to purchase 49 </entity/>MiG-29 MiG-29SMT and 6 MiG-29UBT at an estimated cost of $1.9 billion. It also agreed to return old aircraft purchased from the </entity/>former-USSR former-USSR. Russia is also building two </entity/>Kilo-class-submarine </mention/>636-type diesel </entity/>submarines submarines for Algeria.
Provinces and districts.
Algeria is divided into 48 </entity/>provinces-of-Algeria </mention/>provinces ("</entity/>wilaya wilayas"), 553 </entity/>districts-of-Algeria </mention/>districts ("</entity/>daïra daïras") and 1,541 </entity/>Municipalities-of-Algeria </mention/>municipalities ("</entity/>baladiyah baladiyahs"). Each province, district, and municipality is named after its </entity/>Capital-(political) </mention/>seat, which is usually the largest city.
The administrative divisions have changed several times since independence. When introducing new provinces, the numbers of old provinces are kept, hence the non-alphabetical order. With their official numbers, currently (since 1983) they are
Economy.
</entity/>
Algeria is classified as an upper middle income country by the </entity/>World-Bank-Group </mention/>World-Bank. Algeria’s currency is the </entity/>Algerian-dinar </mention/>dinar (DZD). The economy remains dominated by the state, a legacy of the country's socialist post-independence development model. In recent years, the Algerian government has halted the privatization of state-owned industries and imposed restrictions on imports and foreign involvement in its economy.
Algeria has struggled to develop industries outside hydrocarbons in part because of high costs and an inert state bureaucracy. The government's efforts to diversify the economy by attracting foreign and domestic investment outside the energy sector have done little to reduce high youth unemployment rates or to address housing shortages. The country is facing a number of short-term and medium-term problems, including the need to diversify the economy, strengthen political, economic and financial reforms, improve the business climate and reduce inequalities amongst regions.
A wave of economic protests in February and March 2011 prompted the Algerian government to offer more than $23 billion in public grants and retroactive salary and benefit increases. Public spending has increased by 27% annually during the past 5 years. The 2010–14 public-investment programme will cost US$286 billion, 40% of which will go to human development.
The Algerian economy grew by 2.6% in 2011, driven by public spending, in particular in the construction and public-works sector, and by growing internal demand. If hydrocarbons are excluded, growth has been estimated at 4.8%. Growth of 3% is expected in 2012, rising to 4.2% in 2013. The rate of inflation was 4% and the budget deficit 3% of GDP. The current-account surplus is estimated at 9.3% of GDP and at the end of December 2011, official reserves were put at US$182 billion. Inflation, the lowest in the region, has remained stable at 4% on average between 2003 and 2007.
</entity/>
In 2011 Algeria announced a budgetary surplus of $26.9 billion, 62% increase in comparison to 2010 surplus. In general, the country exported $73 billion worth of commodities while it imported $46 billion.
Thanks to strong hydrocarbon revenues, Algeria has a cushion of $173 billion in </entity/>foreign-currency-reserves foreign-currency-reserves and a large hydrocarbon stabilization fund. In addition, Algeria's </entity/>List-of-countries-by-external-debt </mention/>external-debt is extremely low at about 2% of GDP. The economy remains very dependent on hydrocarbon wealth, and, despite high foreign exchange reserves (US$178 billion, equivalent to three years of imports), current expenditure growth makes Algeria's budget more vulnerable to the risk of prolonged lower hydrocarbon revenues.
In 2011, the agricultural sector and services recorded growth of 10% and 5.3%, respectively. About 14% of the labor force are employed in the </entity/>Agriculture-in-Algeria </mention/>agricultural-sector. Fiscal policy in 2011 remained expansionist and made it possible to maintain the pace of public investment and to contain the strong demand for jobs and housing.
Algeria has not joined the </entity/>WTO WTO, despite several years of negotiations.
In March 2006, Russia agreed to erase $4.74 billion of Algeria's </entity/>Soviet-Union </mention/>Soviet-era debt during a visit by </entity/>President-of-Russia </mention/>Russian-President </entity/>Vladimir-Putin Vladimir-Putin to the country, the first by a Russian leader in half a century. In return, </entity/>President-of-Algeria </mention/>Algerian-President </entity/>Abdelaziz-Bouteflika Abdelaziz-Bouteflika agreed to buy $7.5 billion worth of combat planes, air-defense systems and other arms from Russia, according to the head of Russia's state arms exporter </entity/>Rosoboronexport Rosoboronexport.
Hydrocarbons.
Algeria, whose economy is reliant on petroleum, has been an </entity/>OPEC OPEC member since 1969. Its crude oil production stands at around 1.1 million barrels/day, but it is also a major gas producer and exporter, with important links to Europe. Hydrocarbons have long been the backbone of the economy, accounting for roughly 60% of budget revenues, 30% of GDP, and over 95% of export earnings. Algeria has the </entity/>List-of-countries-by-natural-gas-proven-reserves </mention/>10th-largest-reserves-of-natural-gas in the world and is the </entity/>List-of-countries-by-natural-gas-exports </mention/>sixth-largest-gas-exporter. The U.S. </entity/>Energy-Information-Administration Energy-Information-Administration reported that in 2005, Algeria had of proven </entity/>natural-gas-reserves </mention/>natural-gas-reserves. It also ranks </entity/>List-of-countries-by-proven-oil-reserves </mention/>16th-in-oil-reserves.
Non-hydrocarbon growth for 2011 was projected at 5%. To cope with social demands, the authorities raised expenditure, especially on basic food support, employment creation, support for SMEs, and higher salaries. High hydrocarbon prices have improved the current account and the already large international reserves position.
Income from oil and gas rose in 2011 as a result of continuing high oil prices, though the trend in production volume is downwards. Production from the oil and gas sector in terms of volume, continues to decline, dropping from 43.2 million tonnes to 32 million tonnes between 2007 and 2011. Nevertheless, the sector accounted for 98% of the total volume of exports in 2011, against 48% in 1962, and 70% of budgetary receipts, or USD 71.4 billion.
The Algerian national oil company is </entity/>Sonatrach Sonatrach, which plays a key role in all aspects of the oil and natural gas sectors in Algeria. All foreign operators must work in partnership with Sonatrach, which usually has majority ownership in production-sharing agreements.
Labour market.
Despite a decline in total unemployment, youth and women unemployment is high. Unemployment particularly affects the young, with a jobless rate of 21.5% among the 15–24 age group.
The overall rate of unemployment was 10% in 2011, but remained higher among young people, with a rate of 21.5% for those aged between 15 and 24. The government strengthened in 2011 the job programmes introduced in 1988, in particular in the framework of the programme to aid those seeking work (Dispositif d'Aide à l'Insertion Professionnelle).
Tourism.
</entity/>
The development of the tourism sector in Algeria had previously been hampered by a lack of facilities, but since 2004 a broad tourism development strategy has been implemented resulting in many hotels of a high modern standard being built.
There are several </entity/>UNESCO UNESCO </entity/>World-Heritage-Sites World-Heritage-Sites in Algeria including </entity/>Al-Qal'a-of-Beni-Hammad Al-Qal'a-of-Beni-Hammad, the first capital of the </entity/>Hammadid Hammadid empire; </entity/>Tipasa Tipasa, a Phoenician and later Roman town; and </entity/>Djémila Djémila and </entity/>Timgad Timgad, both </entity/>Ancient-Rome </mention/>Roman ruins; </entity/>M'Zab-Valley M'Zab-Valley, a limestone valley containing a large urbanized </entity/>oasis oasis; also the </entity/>Casbah Casbah of Algiers is an important citadel. The only natural </entity/>World-Heritage-Sites World-Heritage-Sites is the </entity/>Tassili-n'Ajjer Tassili-n'Ajjer, a mountain range.
Transport.
</entity/>
</entity/>
